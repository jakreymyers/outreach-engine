Before using this prompt, prepare:

1. **Target info** - Who you want to reach
2. **Connection type** - How you're connected (mutual contact, same community, met before, etc.)
3. **What you're asking for** - Introduction, direct conversation, advice
4. **What you're working on** - Brief context on your project

## The Prompt

Copy everything below the line and paste into your AI tool:

I need to craft a warm introduction message.

**Target:**
- Name: [TARGET NAME]
- Role: [e.g., "Founder of X" or "Head of Product at Y"]
- Why I want to talk to them: [e.g., "They've been through the validation process I'm trying to understand"]

**My connection:**
[Select one and provide details]

- **Mutual contact:** [NAME] knows both of us. Our relationship: [e.g., "worked together for 2 years"]
- **Same community:** We're both in [COMMUNITY]. They may recognize my name/avatar from [CONTEXT]
- **Shared experience:** We both [e.g., "went through Y Combinator" or "worked at the same company"]
- **Previous interaction:** We [e.g., "exchanged comments on their blog post" or "met briefly at a conference"]
- **Alumni connection:** We both attended/worked at [INSTITUTION]

**What I'm working on:**
[Brief description of your project - 1-2 sentences]

**What I'm asking for:**
[e.g., "15-minute call to discuss their validation experience" or "Introduction to [PERSON]"]

**Generate two types of messages:**

### Type 1: Message to My Connection (asking for intro)
A message to [MUTUAL CONTACT NAME] asking them to introduce me to [TARGET NAME].
- Make it easy for them to forward
- Include a "forwardable blurb" they can copy-paste
- Explain why I want the intro and why it won't waste the target's time

### Type 2: Direct Message (warm, not cold)
A message I'd send directly to [TARGET NAME] that references our connection.
- Lead with the connection to establish context
- Don't make them feel like a warm body on a list
- Make the ask feel natural given the connection

**For each message:**
- Suggested subject line (if email)
- The message itself
- Why this framing works
- What to do if they don't respond

## Example Output

**Target:** Alex Chen, founder of TaskFlow (a project management startup)
**Connection:** Mutual contact - Jamie (my former colleague) went to college with Alex
**Working on:** A tool to help founders validate ideas
**Ask:** 20-minute call to understand how Alex approached early validation

---

### Type 1: Message to Jamie (asking for intro)

**Subject:** Quick favor - intro to Alex Chen?

**Message:**
```
Hey Jamie -

I've been doing customer discovery for a validation tool I'm building, and I'm trying to talk to founders who've been through the early validation stage.

I noticed you went to school with Alex Chen - he built TaskFlow and seems like he'd have a ton of insight on what early-stage founders struggle with.

Would you feel comfortable making an intro? If so, here's a blurb you can forward:

---

Hey Alex - I wanted to connect you with [YOUR NAME]. He's a [YOUR ROLE/CONTEXT] who's building a tool to help founders validate ideas before they build.

He's doing customer research and would love 20 minutes to learn how you approached early validation at TaskFlow. He's not selling anything - just trying to understand the patterns.

I'll let you two take it from here if you're open to it.

---

Totally understand if you'd rather not - I know intro requests can be awkward. Just thought of you because you mentioned working with early-stage founders.

Thanks either way!
```

**Why this works:**
- Makes it dead simple for Jamie to forward (copy-paste blurb)
- Explains the "why" without making Jamie vouch for anything specific
- Gives Jamie an easy out ("totally understand if you'd rather not")
- The blurb is brief and doesn't oversell

**If Jamie doesn't respond:**
Wait a week, then send a brief follow-up: "Hey - just circling back on this. No pressure either way, just wanted to make sure it didn't get buried."

If still no response, don't push. Your relationship with Jamie matters more than this intro.

---

### Type 2: Direct Message to Alex (warm, referencing connection)

**Subject:** Jamie suggested I reach out - quick question

**Message:**
```
Hey Alex -

Jamie [LAST NAME] mentioned we should connect - we worked together at [COMPANY] for a few years.

I'm building a tool to help founders validate ideas before they build, and I've been talking to founders who've been through that messy early stage.

TaskFlow clearly found product-market fit - I'd love to hear how you approached validation in the early days. Any lessons you wish you'd known earlier.

Would you have 20 minutes to chat sometime in the next week or two? I can work around your schedule.

No pitch - just trying to learn from people who've done it.
```

**Why this works:**
- Leads with the connection immediately (establishes "why me")
- Brief context on what you're doing (establishes "why now")
- Specific but open-ended question (establishes "what I want to know")
- Flexible timing ("week or two") reduces pressure
- Explicitly not a pitch (removes skepticism)

**If Alex doesn't respond:**
One follow-up after 5-7 days:
```
Hey Alex - circling back in case this got buried.

Quick version: would love 20 mins to hear how you validated TaskFlow early on.

If timing is bad or it's just not something you have bandwidth for, no worries at all.
```

Then drop it. One follow-up is enough for warm intros.

### Variations by Connection Type

**Same community:**
```
Hey [NAME] - we're both in [COMMUNITY]. I've seen your posts about [TOPIC] and they've been really helpful.

I'm working on [PROJECT] and would love to hear how you thought about [RELEVANT TOPIC]. Would you have 15-20 minutes sometime?
```

**Previous interaction:**
```
Hey [NAME] - we exchanged a few comments on [PLATFORM/POST] last month about [TOPIC].

I've been thinking more about what you said about [SPECIFIC POINT]. Would you be up for a quick call to dig deeper?
```

**Alumni connection:**
```
Hey [NAME] - I saw you went through [PROGRAM/SCHOOL]. I did too back in [YEAR].

I'm working on [PROJECT] and I think your experience with [RELEVANT THING] could be really helpful. Would you have 20 minutes to chat?
```

**Met at event:**
```
Hey [NAME] - we met briefly at [EVENT] - I was the one who [MEMORABLE DETAIL].

I've been thinking about something you mentioned about [TOPIC]. Would you be up for a quick call to explore it further?
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Don't fake warmth** - If the connection is weak, acknowledge it. "We've never met directly, but we're both in X community" is better than pretending you're closer than you are.

2. **Make it easy to say yes** - Flexible timing, brief call, clear topic. Remove every barrier.

3. **Don't overuse mutual connections** - Asking for too many intros burns relationship capital. Be selective.

4. **Update your connector** - After the call, let your mutual contact know how it went. "Thanks for the intro - Alex was super helpful." This keeps the door open for future asks.

5. **Give before you get** - Before asking for intros, offer to help your connections. "Happy to intro you to anyone in my network" builds credit for future asks.

## Follow-Up Prompts

**"My mutual contact said yes but hasn't sent the intro yet. Write a gentle nudge."**

**"I got the intro but the target hasn't responded. Write a follow-up that doesn't make my connector look bad."**

**"Rewrite this as a LinkedIn connection request with a note (max 300 characters)."**

**"The target said they're too busy. Write a response that keeps the door open for later."**
