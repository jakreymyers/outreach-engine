# Cold DM Prompt

**Purpose:** Craft a cold direct message (LinkedIn, Twitter, email) that gets responses by framing outreach as research, not selling.

---

## Context to Provide

Before using this prompt, prepare:

1. **Target info** - Name, role, company, and what you know about them
2. **What you're building** - One sentence description
3. **The ask** - What do you want? (15-min call, feedback, advice)
4. **Why them** - Specific reason you're reaching out to this person

---

## The Prompt

Copy everything below the line and paste into your AI tool:

---

I need to craft a cold DM to [TARGET NAME/DESCRIPTION].

**What I know about them:**
- Role: [e.g., "Founder of a productivity SaaS"]
- Where I found them: [e.g., "Posted on r/startups about customer discovery struggles"]
- Specific signal: [e.g., "They asked 'How do I know if my idea is worth building?'"]
- Other context: [anything else relevant - their product, recent posts, background]

**What I'm building:**
[One sentence - e.g., "A tool that helps founders validate ideas before they build"]

**My ask:**
[e.g., "15-minute call to understand their validation process"]

**Platform:**
[LinkedIn / Twitter DM / Email / Other]

**Generate messages using these three frameworks:**

### Framework 1: The Research Frame
Position as a researcher seeking to understand, not a seller seeking to pitch.
- Lead with curiosity, not capability
- Make them the expert
- Ask permission to learn from them

### Framework 2: The Shared Struggle Frame
Position as a peer who's been through the same thing.
- Acknowledge the specific pain they expressed
- Share vulnerability about your own experience
- Offer mutual value exchange

### Framework 3: The Value-First Frame
Lead with something useful before asking for anything.
- Provide insight, resource, or observation
- No strings attached
- Ask is secondary to the value offered

**For each framework, provide:**
1. The message (platform-appropriate length)
2. Why this framework might work for this target
3. Expected response rate (rough estimate)
4. Best follow-up if no response

**Also include:**
- Subject line (if email)
- Character count
- One thing that would make this message stronger if I knew it
- Red flags to avoid

## Example Output

**Target:** Sarah, founder of a project management tool
**Found on:** r/startups - posted "Just launched and got 3 signups. What am I doing wrong?"
**Building:** A validation tool for founders
**Ask:** 15-minute call to understand validation struggles
**Platform:** Twitter DM

---

### Framework 1: The Research Frame

**Message:**
```
Hey Sarah - saw your r/startups post about your launch.

I'm researching why technical founders struggle with the "what to build" question more than the "how to build" question.

Would you be open to a 15-min call to share your experience? Not selling anything - genuinely trying to understand the pattern.

Either way, congrats on shipping. That takes guts.
```

**Character count:** 347

**Why this might work:**
Sarah just posted publicly about her struggle, signaling she's open to discussing it. The research framing removes sales pressure and positions her as the expert with valuable experience.

**Expected response rate:** 25-35%

**Best follow-up (if no response after 3-5 days):**
```
Hey Sarah - circling back in case this got buried. Totally understand if you're slammed.

Quick question regardless: What's one thing you wish you'd known before launching?

No pressure for a call - even a one-line answer would be super helpful.
```

---

### Framework 2: The Shared Struggle Frame

**Message:**
```
Hey Sarah - your r/startups post hit close to home.

I've launched two things to crickets. The second one hurt more than the first because I'd "done everything right." Turns out I was solving a problem I assumed existed.

I'm trying to figure out how to help founders avoid that trap. Would you be open to swapping notes for 15 min? I can share what I learned from my failures if useful.
```

**Character count:** 399

**Why this might work:**
Sarah is feeling vulnerable after a disappointing launch. A peer who's been there feels safer than a stranger seeking to learn from her pain. The offer to share back creates reciprocity.

**Expected response rate:** 30-40%

**Best follow-up:**
```
Hey - hope the post-launch dust is settling. One thing that helped me: writing down the assumptions I'd made before launch and checking which ones were actually validated.

Anyway, offer stands if you ever want to chat.
```

---

### Framework 3: The Value-First Frame

**Message:**
```
Hey Sarah - read your launch post. Here's something that might help:

I analyzed 50 "launched to crickets" posts on r/startups. The #1 pattern? Founders who talked to users vs. talked about the problem. Users will validate features. But only people with the problem can validate the problem.

Happy to share the full breakdown if useful. And if you ever want to chat about next steps, I'd love to hear what you're thinking.
```

**Character count:** 441

**Why this might work:**
Leads with immediately useful insight. Sarah gets value whether or not she responds. The call becomes optional, which paradoxically increases likelihood of acceptance.

**Expected response rate:** 25-35%

**Best follow-up:**
Share another small piece of value, or reference something new she posted.

---

### General Guidance

**Subject line (if email):**
- "Quick question about your launch" (curiosity)
- "Fellow founder - re: your r/startups post" (peer)
- "Something I noticed analyzing launch posts" (value)

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Starting with "I" instead of "you" or their name
- Mentioning your product before establishing relevance
- Generic compliments ("Love what you're building!")
- Long paragraphs that look effortful to read
- Anything that sounds templated

**What would make this stronger:**
If I knew what she's tried already for validation, I could reference it and offer a contrasting approach.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Actually read their content** - Reference specific things they said. Generic outreach gets generic (non-)responses.

2. **Keep it short** - Twitter DMs: under 280 characters ideal. LinkedIn: under 300 words. Email: under 150 words for cold outreach.

3. **Make the ask tiny** - "15 minutes" is better than "a call." "One question" is better than "15 minutes."

4. **Send at the right time** - Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM in their timezone gets highest response rates.

5. **Don't follow up too fast** - Wait 5-7 days before following up. One follow-up is fine. Two is the max.

6. **Track what works** - Keep notes on which framework gets responses. Double down on what works for your audience.

## Platform-Specific Tips

### Twitter DM
- If they don't follow you, you may need to pay for Premium or wait until they follow you
- Shorter is better. Get under 280 chars if possible
- Don't use formal language - Twitter is casual
- Profile matters - they'll check who's messaging them

### LinkedIn
- Personalized connection request > InMail
- Include a note with the connection request
- Don't pitch in the connection request - just connect
- Wait until they accept, then message

### Email (cold)
- Subject line determines if it's opened
- First line shows in preview - make it count
- Include clear call-to-action at the end
- Expect 10-20% response rate on cold email (lower than DMs)

## Follow-Up Prompts

**"Rewrite this message to be 30% shorter while keeping the core."**

**"They responded positively but didn't book. Write a response that moves toward scheduling."**

**"They said no. Write a graceful close that leaves the door open."**

**"I'm reaching out to 5 similar people. Create a template I can personalize in 2 minutes per person."**
