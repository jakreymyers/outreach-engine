I need to write a community post for [COMMUNITY NAME].

**About the community:**
- Platform: [e.g., Reddit, Indie Hackers, Discord, etc.]
- Size: [approximate members/subscribers]
- Culture: [e.g., "supportive, beginner-friendly" or "critical, technical" or "anti-self-promotion"]
- Rules: [any specific rules about self-promotion, feedback requests, etc.]

**What I'm exploring:**
[e.g., "How founders struggle to validate ideas before building"]

**What I want to achieve:**
[Select primary goal]
- Start discussions that help me understand the problem better
- Get feedback on an early concept
- Find people willing to have a conversation
- Share something valuable while establishing myself in the community

**My constraints:**
- Can I mention I'm building something? [Yes / No / Only if relevant]
- Have I been active in this community before? [Yes - how long / No - first post]
- Am I okay being identified as the builder? [Yes / Prefer anonymous]

**Generate three post types:**

### Type 1: The Question Post
A genuine question that invites people to share their experiences.
- Opens discussion without revealing an agenda
- Gets people talking about the problem
- Positions me as curious, not promoting

### Type 2: The Value Post
Share something genuinely useful that demonstrates expertise.
- Provides value regardless of whether they engage further
- Establishes credibility
- Natural conversation starter in comments

### Type 3: The Research Request
Transparently ask for help with research.
- Clear about what I'm doing and why
- Specific about what I'm asking for
- Gives something back

**For each post:**
- Headline/title
- Full post text
- Why this works for this community
- What to do in the comments
- Risks to watch for

---

## Example Output

**Community:** r/startups (400K+ members)
**Culture:** Mix of experienced and new founders, self-promotion is restricted
**Rules:** No direct self-promotion, "Shameless Saturday" for sharing your own stuff
**Exploring:** How founders validate ideas before building
**Goal:** Find people to have conversations with
**Can mention building:** Only if relevant and not promotional

---

### Type 1: The Question Post

**Title:**
`How did you know your idea was worth building?`

**Post:**
```
I've been lurking here for a while and notice the same pattern: technical founders who can build anything struggling with knowing what to build.

I'm in that boat. I can ship product but I keep second-guessing whether the idea is even worth the time.

For those who've found some traction:
- How did you know you were onto something before you built?
- What was the signal that made you commit?
- If you could go back, what would you do differently?

Especially interested in hearing from folks who validated before building (if that's even possible).
```

**Why this works:**
- Opens with observation, not personal pitch
- Positions as fellow struggler, not expert
- Specific questions invite specific answers
- "Lurking for a while" establishes presence
- No mention of building anything (yet)

**In the comments:**
- Reply genuinely to each response
- Ask follow-up questions
- When rapport is established: "This is super helpful - would you be open to a quick call to dig deeper?"
- Don't pitch. If someone asks what you're building, be brief and redirect to their experience.

**Risks:**
- Might get buried (post timing matters - try Tuesday-Thursday morning)
- Could attract generic advice instead of real experiences
- Might attract "it depends" non-answers

### Type 2: The Value Post

**Title:**
`I analyzed 50 "launched to crickets" posts. Here's what they had in common.`

**Post:**
```
I went through 50 posts on r/startups and r/SideProject where founders launched and got zero traction. Wanted to find the pattern.

**What I found:**

1. **Talked to users, not people with the problem (40/50)**
Most talked to potential users about features. Almost none talked to people experiencing the core problem before deciding to build.

2. **Built for "people like them" without verifying (35/50)**
"I have this problem, so others must too." Rarely verified this assumption with anyone outside their immediate circle.

3. **No clear signal before building (48/50)**
When asked "what told you this was worth building?" most said some version of "I just thought it was a good idea."

4. **Launched to "everyone" (42/50)**
No specific person or community targeted. Just put it on Product Hunt and hoped.

**What successful launchers did differently (n=12 comparison):**
- Talked to people experiencing the problem before deciding what to build
- Had specific people excited before launch
- Launched to a specific community, not "the internet"

**Caveats:**
- Small sample, not rigorous research
- Survivor bias in the "successful" group
- Correlation isn't causation

Happy to share the raw data if anyone wants to dig in.

What patterns have you noticed in your own launches or others'?
```

**Why this works:**
- Leads with original research/data (high-value)
- Not self-promotional (no product mentioned)
- Invites discussion at the end
- Caveats show intellectual honesty
- Offer to share raw data creates engagement opportunity

**In the comments:**
- Share additional findings if people ask
- Ask people about their own experiences
- If someone says "I wish I'd done this" - that's a potential conversation target
- Can mention "I'm exploring building something in this space" if someone asks directly

**Risks:**
- Takes time to do the actual research
- Might get challenged on methodology (be humble)
- Could get flagged if mods think it's a disguised promotion

### Type 3: The Research Request

**Title:**
`Seeking 5 founders for 15-min research conversations (not selling anything)`

**Post:**
```
I'm researching how early-stage founders approach validation - specifically the gap between "I have an idea" and "I know this is worth building."

**What I'm looking for:**
- Founders who've launched at least one thing (successful or not)
- Currently working on something in the validation phase
- 15-20 minutes for a Zoom/phone conversation

**What I'm NOT doing:**
- Not selling anything
- Not pitching a product
- Not adding you to a list

**What you'd get:**
- Summary of what I learn from all conversations (if you want it)
- Someone to think through your validation challenges with
- Happy to share anything I've learned from my own failed attempts

**Why I'm doing this:**
I'm exploring building a tool to help with validation. Trying to understand if the problem is real and what people actually need (meta, I know).

If you're interested, drop a comment or DM me. Even if you just want to rant about how hard validation is, I'm here for it.

Thanks in advance.
```

**Why this works:**
- Completely transparent about intentions
- Specific about what you're asking (5 people, 15 min)
- Clear "what's in it for them"
- Self-aware about the irony ("meta, I know")
- Multiple ways to engage (comment, DM, or just rant)

**In the comments:**
- Thank everyone who responds
- If someone comments but doesn't volunteer, engage with their point first - don't push for the call
- Be responsive quickly - momentum matters on research requests

**Risks:**
- Some communities don't allow any research requests
- Might get fewer responses than cold outreach (paradoxically)
- Could attract people who want to help but aren't your target

## Platform-Specific Tips

### Reddit
- Check r/[community]/wiki for rules first
- Use flairs if required
- Don't post and run - engage for at least an hour after posting
- Timing matters: weekday mornings US time typically best

### Indie Hackers
- More tolerant of building-in-public content
- Use milestones for updates about what you're learning
- Engage in other threads before posting your own

### Discord
- Find the right channel (many have specific channels for feedback/research)
- Introduce yourself first if there's an intro channel
- DM follow-ups are more acceptable here

### Twitter/X
- Threads perform better than single posts
- Tag relevant people (sparingly, don't spam)
- Ask for RTs to extend reach
- Follow up with commenters via DM

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Lurk first** - Spend at least a week reading posts before posting. Understand the culture.

2. **Engage before asking** - Answer other people's questions, comment on posts, be a contributor first.

3. **Timing matters** - Post when the community is active. Test different times.

4. **Follow up quickly** - Respond to every comment within the first hour. Engagement begets engagement.

5. **Don't cross-post immediately** - Posting the same thing across 5 communities at once looks spammy. Space it out.

6. **Save the wins** - Screenshot interesting comments. These become personalization hooks for future outreach.

## Follow-Up Prompts

**"Someone left this comment: [PASTE]. Draft a reply that moves toward a conversation."**

**"My post got removed for violating rules. Rewrite it to comply with: [RULES]."**

**"I got 20 comments but no one is taking me up on the call. What do I do?"**

**"Adapt this r/startups post for Indie Hackers format."**
