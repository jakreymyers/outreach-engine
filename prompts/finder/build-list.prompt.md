---

## Context to Provide

Before using this prompt, prepare:

## The Prompt

Copy everything below the line and paste into your AI tool:

---

I need to build a prioritized target list for outreach. I'm solving [PROBLEM] for [TARGET AUDIENCE].

**Communities I'm monitoring:**
[LIST YOUR COMMUNITIES - e.g., r/startups, Indie Hackers, etc.]

**Example signals I've found:**
[PASTE 2-3 EXAMPLE POSTS/COMMENTS THAT SHOW THE PROBLEM]

Based on these signals and communities, help me create a target list framework and then generate example targets I should look for.

**For each target profile, provide:**

1. **Profile Name** (descriptive label)
2. **Signal Pattern** (what their posts/comments look like)
3. **Where to Find Them** (specific community, search query)
4. **Priority Score** (1-5, where 5 = highest priority)
5. **Personalization Hooks** (what to reference in outreach)
6. **Best Approach** (DM, comment, community post, etc.)
7. **Timing** (when to reach out relative to their signal)

**Create 5-7 target profiles**, from highest priority to lowest.

**Then provide:**

### Target List Template

A template I can use to track actual people as I find them, with columns for:
- Name/handle
- Source (where I found them)
- Signal (what they said/did)
- Signal strength (1-3)
- Personalization notes
- Status (not reached / reached / replied / booked)
- Date found
- Notes

### Search Strategy

For each community, give me:
- The exact search query to use
- What day/time posts typically appear
- How often to check

### Qualification Questions

Before adding someone to my list, what 3-5 questions should I answer about them to ensure they're worth pursuing?

---

## Example Output

**Problem:** Founders struggle to validate ideas before building
**Communities:** r/startups, Indie Hackers, r/SaaS
**Signals:** Posts asking "how do I validate," frustrated launch posts, customer discovery questions

### Target Profiles

#### Profile 1: The Frustrated Launcher (Priority: 5/5)

**Signal Pattern:**
"Just launched [product] and got no signups/traction. What did I do wrong?"

**Where to Find:**
- r/startups: Search `"launched" "no traction"` or `"launched" "crickets"`
- Indie Hackers: Check "milestones" section for launch posts with 0-10 upvotes
- Twitter: Search `"launched" "nobody signed up"`

**Personalization Hooks:**
- Reference their specific product
- Acknowledge the emotional difficulty of launching to silence
- Note something specific they built (shows you looked at it)

**Best Approach:**
Comment with genuine empathy first ("I've been there - launched two things to silence"). Let them respond, then offer to share what you learned.

**Timing:**
Within 48 hours of their post. Pain is fresh. They're looking for answers.

---

#### Profile 2: The Pre-Launch Validator (Priority: 5/5)

**Signal Pattern:**
"How do I validate before I build?" or "Should I talk to customers first?" or "What's the best way to do customer discovery?"

**Where to Find:**
- r/startups: Search `"validate before building"` or `"customer discovery how"`
- Indie Hackers: Search `validate`
- r/Entrepreneur: Search `"how to know if idea"`

**Personalization Hooks:**
- Reference the specific idea they mentioned (if any)
- Note that they're being smart by validating first
- Connect to a struggle you had at the same stage

**Best Approach:**
Answer their question with genuine, tactical advice. Don't pitch. In the answer, mention you're building something in this space and would love to hear more about their situation.

**Timing:**
Within 24 hours. They're actively seeking help.

---

#### Profile 3: The Research Tool Seeker (Priority: 4/5)

**Signal Pattern:**
"What tools do you use for customer research?" or "Best way to find people to interview?" or "How do you track customer feedback?"

**Where to Find:**
- r/startups: Search `"tools" "customer research"`
- Indie Hackers: Search `interview tools` or `user research`
- r/SaaS: Search `customer feedback tool`

**Personalization Hooks:**
- Reference tools they mentioned trying
- Share a tool recommendation (even if it's not yours)
- Offer to share your research process

**Best Approach:**
Answer with value first. List 2-3 tools you've used and what you liked/disliked. Then add: "I'm actually building something in this space - would love to hear what's not working about current options."

**Timing:**
Within 24 hours. They're actively evaluating.

---

#### Profile 4: The Manual Processor (Priority: 4/5)

**Signal Pattern:**
Describing manual workarounds: "I use a spreadsheet to track..." or "I manually DM people one by one" or "My process involves copying stuff between tools"

**Where to Find:**
- Any community: Search `"spreadsheet"` + your problem keywords
- Indie Hackers: Search `my process for` or `how I do`

**Personalization Hooks:**
- Reference their specific workaround
- Acknowledge the effort they're putting in
- Ask what's most painful about their current process

**Best Approach:**
Express genuine interest in their process. "Your workflow sounds really thoughtful - I'm curious what takes the most time?" Opens a conversation without pitching.

**Timing:**
Not urgent. Monitor and reach out when you see the pattern.

#### Profile 5: The Second-Time Founder (Priority: 4/5)

- Acknowledge the wisdom they gained
- Note you're trying to help others avoid the same mistake

**Best Approach:**
Appeal to their expertise. "I noticed you went through this - would love 15 minutes to hear what you wish you'd had access to." They become the expert, not the target.

Anytime. They're always receptive to this framing.

### Target List Template

Copy this to a spreadsheet:

| # | Name/Handle | Source | Signal (what they said) | Strength (1-3) | Personalization Note | Status | Date Found | Date Contacted | Response | Notes |
|---|-------------|--------|------------------------|----------------|---------------------|--------|------------|----------------|----------|-------|
| 1 | | | | | | Not Reached | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | Not Reached | | | | |

**Status values:** Not Reached > Reached > Replied > Booked > Completed > Not Interested

---

### Search Strategy

| Community | Search Query | Best Time to Check | Check Frequency |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| r/startups | `"validate" OR "validation"` | Weekday mornings | 3x per week |
| r/startups | `"launched" "no traction"` | Mondays (post-weekend launches) | 2x per week |
| Indie Hackers | `validate` in search | Anytime | 2x per week |
| Indie Hackers | Browse "milestones" for low-engagement launches | Wednesdays | Weekly |
| Twitter | `"customer discovery" struggling` | Evenings | Daily quick scan |

---

### Qualification Questions

Before adding to list, answer:

1. **Is this person actually building something?** (Not just asking theoretical questions)
2. **Are they in my target segment?** (Right company size, stage, industry)
3. **Do they have decision-making authority?** (Founder, not employee asking for boss)
4. **Is the signal recent?** (Within last 30 days ideally)
5. **Can I personalize meaningfully?** (Enough public info to reference)

If you can't answer "yes" to at least 4 of these, skip to the next target.

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with 10, not 100** - Quality over quantity. 10 well-researched targets beat 100 spray-and-pray attempts.

2. **Set a daily cap** - Find 2-3 new targets per day max. Otherwise you'll spend all your time finding, not reaching.

3. **Prioritize fresh signals** - Posts from the last 7 days get dramatically better response rates.

4. **Track everything** - Even "not interested" responses are data. Track why you chose each target and what happened.

5. **Review weekly** - Look at your list every week. Are certain profiles converting better? Double down.

---

## Follow-Up Prompts

**"Here's a post I found: [PASTE]. Score this person as a target and draft a personalization hook."**

**"I've found 15 targets. Help me prioritize: [PASTE LIST]. Which 5 should I reach out to first?"**

**"My response rate has been low. Review these targets and messages: [PASTE]. What am I missing?"**
