I need a sales discovery script. I've validated my product and I'm ready to sell, but I need to qualify prospects and understand their buying process.

**My product:**
[e.g., "A validation tool that helps founders test ideas before building"]

**Core value proposition:**
[e.g., "Compress months of guesswork into structured validation in days"]

**Target customer:**
[e.g., "First-time founders building B2B SaaS side projects"]

**This prospect:**
- Name/role: [e.g., "Sarah, founder of a project management tool"]
- Company stage: [e.g., "Pre-revenue, 6 months into building"]
- How we connected: [e.g., "Replied to my cold DM about validation struggles"]
- What I know about them: [e.g., "Launched once, got no traction, trying again"]

**Pricing:**
[e.g., "$49/month or $499/year - single pricing tier"]

**Meeting context:**
- Duration: [15 / 30 / 45 minutes]
- Their expectation: [Demo / Discovery call / Casual chat]

**Generate:**

**Product:** Validation tool for founders
**Value prop:** Test ideas in days, not months
**Target:** First-time B2B SaaS founders
**Prospect:** Sarah, founder of TaskFlow, post-launch trying to find traction
**Pricing:** $49/month

### 1. Discovery Framework

**BANT-ish Framework (adapted for founders):**

| Element | Question Focus | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Problem** | Is the problem real and painful for them? | No pain = no sale |
| **Authority** | Can they make the buying decision? | Founders usually can |
| **Need** | Do they need this now, or someday? | Timing drives urgency |
| **Timeline** | When do they need to solve this? | Creates deadline |
| **Budget** | Can they afford it? Will they spend? | Don't waste time on no-budget |

**For founder-to-founder sales, also explore:**
- Emotional state (how frustrated are they?)
- Previous attempts (what have they tried?)
- Definition of success (what would good look like?)

---

### 2. Full Script with Questions

#### Opening (2 min)

```
Thanks for taking the time, Sarah. Before we dive in:
- How much time do we have?
- What would make this conversation valuable for you?
- Any specific questions you came in with?
```

**Why this works:** Puts them in control, surfaces expectations, sets collaborative tone.

---

#### Current State (8 min)

**Understanding their situation:**

1. **"Tell me about TaskFlow - what stage are you at?"**
   - *Listen for:* Revenue, users, time invested, frustration level

2. **"You mentioned you launched and didn't get the traction you wanted. What happened?"**
   - *Listen for:* What they tried, what failed, what they learned

3. **"What do you think went wrong?"**
   - *Listen for:* Self-awareness, whether they identify validation as the issue

4. **"What are you doing now to figure out what to build next?"**
   - *Listen for:* Current process, effort level, satisfaction with approach

**Transition:** "It sounds like you've put in a lot of work but the market response hasn't matched the effort. Is that fair?"

---

#### Pain Quantification (5 min)

**Making the problem concrete:**

5. **"How much time have you spent on TaskFlow so far?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "How does that feel, given where you are now?"

6. **"What has this cost you - not just money, but time, energy, opportunity?"**
   - *Listen for:* Numbers, emotional language, specific examples

7. **"If this continues for another 6 months, what happens?"**
   - *Listen for:* Consequences, urgency, stakes

8. **"What would it be worth to you to avoid going through this again?"**
   - *Listen for:* Willingness to invest, value perception

**Key insight to capture:** Get a specific number if possible. "So you've invested roughly 6 months and $10K, and if you'd known in month 1 that this wasn't going to work, you'd have saved 5 months and $8K?"

---

#### Future State (4 min)

**What does success look like?**

9. **"Fast forward 6 months. What does success look like for your next project?"**
   - *Listen for:* Goals, metrics, definition of traction

10. **"What would need to be true for you to feel confident about an idea before building?"**
    - *Listen for:* Criteria, evidence they'd accept

11. **"If you had that confidence, what would change about how you work?"**
    - *Listen for:* Behavior change, commitment level

---

#### Solution Fit (5 min)

**Connecting your product to their situation:**

12. **"Based on what you've told me, here's what I'm thinking..."**

```
[Brief positioning statement - 30 seconds max]

"What we do is help founders like you compress the validation phase. Instead of building for months and hoping, you'd have evidence about whether the idea is worth pursuing in days, not months.

For someone like you who's been through a failed launch, the value is avoiding another 6-month cycle that ends the same way."
```

13. **"Does that resonate with where you are?"**
    - *Listen for:* Engagement level, follow-up questions, objections

14. **"What questions do you have about how this works?"**
    - *Let them drive* - their questions reveal priorities

---

#### Decision Process (4 min)

**Understanding how they'll decide:**

15. **"If this seemed like a fit, what would your process be for deciding?"**
    - *Listen for:* Solo decision vs. involving others, timeline

16. **"Is there anything that would prevent you from moving forward if you wanted to?"**
    - *Listen for:* Blockers, objections, constraints

17. **"What's your timeline for figuring out your next project?"**
    - *Listen for:* Urgency, deadlines, competing priorities

18. **"Budget question - $49/month - does that fit within what you'd consider investing in tools?"**
    - *Listen for:* Budget objections, value questions

---

#### Close (2 min)

**Moving to next step:**

19. **"Based on our conversation, here's what I think makes sense as a next step..."**

**Option A - Strong signal, ready to buy:**
```
"It sounds like this could save you a lot of time on your next project. Want to give it a shot? I can get you set up right now and we can walk through your current idea together."
```

**Option B - Interested but not ready:**
```
"I'd suggest trying it on a small scale first - run through the validation process on one idea. If it's useful, you'll know. If not, you're out $49. Want to start with a month and see?"
```

**Option C - Needs more info:**
```
"Let me send you a couple examples of founders who've used this. Take a look, and let's reconnect next week. Does [specific day/time] work?"
```

---

### 3. Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"I can do this myself"** | "Totally. You could. Most founders can. The question is will you? What I've found is that having structure makes the difference between actually validating and meaning to validate. What's kept you from doing it systematically before?" |
| **"$49/month is a lot for a side project"** | "I hear you - every dollar matters when you're bootstrapping. Let me ask this: how much would you pay to know in week 2 that TaskFlow wasn't going to work? What did those extra 5 months cost you?" |
| **"I'm not ready yet - still building"** | "That makes sense. Here's what I'd suggest: the best time to validate is before you're too deep. But I get it - finishing what you started matters. Let me send you something useful for when you're ready. When do you expect to hit a decision point?" |
| **"I need to think about it"** | "Absolutely - this is your decision. Help me understand: what specifically do you need to think through? [Listen] Is there anything I can help you work through right now?" |
| **"I've tried tools like this before"** | "What did you try? [Listen] What didn't work about it? [Listen] Yeah, a lot of tools give you templates but not process. What we do differently is [specific differentiator]. Does that address what didn't work before?" |

### 4. Closing Approaches

**The Trial Close:**
"If I could show you exactly how this would work for your next idea, would you be ready to move forward?"

**The Assumptive Close:**
"Let's get you set up. What email should I send the invite to?"

**The Alternative Close:**
"Would you rather start with a monthly subscription to test it out, or go annual and save 2 months?"

**The Takeaway Close:**
"Based on what you've told me, this might not be the right fit for where you are. You seem pretty committed to finishing TaskFlow first. Let me know when you're ready to start something new."

**The Next Step Close:**
"I don't need you to decide today. But I do need to know: is this worth continuing to explore, or should we part ways here?"

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Discovery before demo** - Never demo without understanding their situation first. You'll pitch the wrong things.

2. **Ask, don't tell** - The more they talk, the more they sell themselves.

3. **Quantify the pain** - "It's frustrating" matters less than "I've wasted 6 months and $10K."

4. **Create urgency honestly** - Don't manufacture false urgency. Find real deadlines or consequences.

5. **Always get a next step** - Never end a call without knowing what happens next, even if it's "we're not a fit."

---
