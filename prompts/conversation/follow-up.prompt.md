Subject: Great chatting - and one thought on TaskFlow

Hey Sarah,

Thanks for the conversation today. The story about launching TaskFlow and having 3 people sign up after 6 months of building - that landed hard. I've been there.

Really appreciated your openness about what didn't work.

Next step on our end: I'm sending you the trial link now. No pressure on timeline - just wanted to make sure you have it when you're ready to dig in.

One thing I was thinking about after our call: you mentioned feeling uncertain about whether the next idea is any better. That "is this just me?" question. If it helps, that's exactly where the validation process starts - separating your assumptions from evidence.

Anyway, let me know how it goes. Happy to jump on a quick call when you start to walk through your first validation together.

Talk soon,
[Your name]
```

---

### 2. Next Step Message (3-5 days later if no action)

**Purpose:** Gentle nudge if she hasn't started the trial

**Template:**
```
Subject: Quick check-in

Hey Sarah,

Wanted to check in - did you get a chance to start the validation process on your next idea?

No pressure if timing isn't right. Just wanted to make sure the trial link worked and you weren't stuck on anything.

If it helps, most people start by running through the problem validation section first. Takes about 20 minutes and gives you a clear sense of whether the problem is real.

Let me know if I can help with anything.

[Your name]
```

**When to send:** 3-5 days after initial message if no response or action

---

### 3. Re-engagement Message (if they go completely silent)

**When to send:** 10-14 days after last contact

**How to re-engage without being annoying:**
- Lead with value, not "just checking in"
- Give them an easy out
- Keep it short

**Template:**
```
Subject: Something that might help (no response needed)

Hey Sarah,

I know you're probably slammed building - wanted to share something quick that might be useful.

[Include one of these - pick what fits:]
- I just wrote up a short guide on the exact validation process we talked about. Attached in case useful.
- Another founder I talked to had a similar "launched to crickets" experience. Here's what worked for her: [brief insight]
- Quick thought on TaskFlow: have you considered [specific, relevant suggestion]?

Either way, no pressure to respond. Just wanted to share while it was on my mind.

Rooting for you.

[Your name]
```

**Note:** Only send 1-2 re-engagement attempts. After that, move them to long-term nurture.

---

### 4. Nurture Message (for "not now" outcomes)

**When to send:** 4-6 weeks after last contact, then every 6-8 weeks

**Purpose:** Stay top-of-mind without being pushy

**Template (v1 - sharing something useful):**
```
Subject: Thought of you - quick resource

Hey Sarah,

Random thing I came across that made me think of our conversation: [brief description of article, tool, or insight relevant to their situation]

[Link or one-line summary]

Hope the next project is going well. Would love to hear how it's going whenever you have time.

[Your name]
```

**Template (v2 - genuine check-in):**
```
Subject: How's the next project going?

Hey Sarah,

It's been a couple months since we talked. Curious how things are going with the next idea.

Did you end up pivoting TaskFlow, or starting something new?

No agenda - just genuinely curious. Our conversation stuck with me.

[Your name]
```

**Template (v3 - milestone trigger):**
```
Subject: Saw your update - congrats!

Hey Sarah,

Just saw [their announcement - launch, milestone, press, etc]. Congrats!

Curious how the validation process went this time around. Did you do anything differently?

Either way, cool to see the progress.

## Specific Situation Templates

### They said "send me more info"

```
Subject: The info you asked for

Hey [Name],

As promised, here's [the specific thing they asked for].

[Brief, 2-3 sentences max about what it is and why it matters to their situation]

Let me know if you have questions. Happy to jump on a quick call to walk through it.

[Your name]

### They said "I need to talk to my co-founder"

```
Subject: Anything I can provide for your conversation?

Hey [Name],

I know you're talking to [co-founder name] about this. Wanted to see if there's anything I can provide that would help - a summary, a case study, or just hopping on a quick call with both of you.

Let me know what would be most useful.

[Your name]
```

### They ghosted after saying yes

```
Subject: Should I close the loop?

Hey [Name],

I haven't heard back and want to respect your time.

Should I assume timing isn't right and check back in a few months? Or is there something holding things up that I can help with?

Either way is totally fine - just want to know where we stand.

[Your name]
```

### Great conversation but they said no

```
Subject: Thanks for the candor

Hey [Name],

Appreciate you being direct about it not being the right fit. That's actually really helpful - saves us both time.

One ask: would you be open to connecting me with anyone else who might be struggling with [the problem]? No pressure - just figured you might know someone.

Either way, thanks for the conversation. Learned a lot.

[Your name]
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Send within 24 hours** - The thank you message should go out the same day or next morning. Every day you wait reduces effectiveness.

2. **Reference specifics** - The #1 thing that makes follow-ups feel personal is referencing something specific from your conversation.

3. **One CTA max** - Don't give them multiple things to do. One clear next step.

4. **Short > Long** - Follow-ups should be shorter than initial outreach. They've already talked to you.

5. **Know when to stop** - 3 follow-ups max. After that, move to long-term nurture or let them go.

## Follow-Up Prompts

**"This person said they'd get back to me in a week. It's been two weeks. Write a follow-up that doesn't sound desperate."**

**"They responded positively to my follow-up but didn't take action. What's my next move?"**

**"I want to re-engage 10 old leads at once. Create a batch-friendly template."**

**"They said they're 'too early' for this. How do I stay in touch without being annoying?"**
