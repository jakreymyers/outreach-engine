I need a validation interview script for customer discovery.

**My problem hypothesis:**
[e.g., "First-time founders struggle to validate ideas before building because they don't have a structured process"]

**Target customer:**
[e.g., "First-time founders building side projects who have launched at least one thing"]

**What I want to learn:**
1. [e.g., "Is the problem real? Do they actually struggle with validation?"]
2. [e.g., "How do they currently try to solve it?"]
3. [e.g., "How much time/money does this problem cost them?"]
4. [e.g., "Would they pay to solve it?"]

**Interview context:**
[e.g., "They responded to a cold DM asking to share their experience"]

**Interview format:**
- Duration: [15 / 30 / 45 minutes]
- Medium: [Zoom / phone / in-person]
- Recording: [Yes, with permission / No, just notes]

**Generate:**

### 1. Interview Framework
A structured flow for the conversation including:
- Opening (rapport building, context setting)
- Background questions (understand their situation)
- Problem exploration (uncover pain without leading)
- Current solution exploration (how they cope today)
- Impact quantification (time, money, emotion)
- Solution ideation (what would help)
- Closing (next steps, thank you)

### 2. Full Question Script
For each section, provide:
- Primary questions (must-ask)
- Follow-up probes (dig deeper)
- Things to listen for (signals)
- What NOT to ask (leading questions to avoid)

### 3. Anti-Leading Guidelines
How to ask questions that don't bias the answers.

### 4. Signal Scorecard
A checklist to score the interview afterward:
- Problem validation signals
- Willingness to pay signals
- Urgency signals
- Fit signals (are they your target customer?)

### 2. Full Question Script

#### Opening (3 min)

**What to say:**
```
Thanks so much for taking the time. Before we start:
- This should take about 30 minutes
- I'm going to ask about your experience, not pitch anything
- [If recording] Is it okay if I record this for my notes? I won't share it anywhere.
- There are no wrong answers - I'm trying to understand, not test you
- Any questions before we start?
```

**Rapport builder:**
- Reference something from their profile/post: "I saw you're working on [X] - what got you excited about that space?"

---

**Primary questions:**

1. **"Tell me about what you're building right now."**

2. **"What stage are you at - idea, building, launched?"**
   - *Follow-up:* "What's the next milestone you're working toward?"

**Things to listen for:**
- How many things have they tried before?

---

#### Closing (1 min)

**What to say:**
```
This has been incredibly helpful. A few quick things:

1. Is there anything I should have asked but didn't?
2. Do you know anyone else who thinks about this stuff that I should talk to?
3. Would it be okay to follow up if I have more questions?

Thank you again - I really appreciate your time.
```

### 3. Anti-Leading Guidelines

**The Mom Test Rules (from Rob Fitzpatrick):**

1. **Talk about their life, not your idea**
   - Bad: "Do you think this product would help you?"
   - Good: "What do you do when this problem comes up?"

2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics about the future**
   - Bad: "Would you use this?"
   - Good: "When was the last time this happened? What did you do?"

3. **Talk less, listen more**
   - Aim for 80% them, 20% you
   - Count to 3 before speaking after they answer

4. **Never mention your solution until asked**
   - If they ask what you're building, say "I'm still figuring that out - trying to understand the problem first"

5. **Seek facts, not opinions**
   - Bad: "Do you think this is a problem?"
   - Good: "Tell me about the last time you experienced this."

**Red flags that you're leading:**
- You're doing more than 30% of the talking
- They're agreeing with everything
- Answers are short and non-specific
- They're telling you what you want to hear
- You feel good about the interview (you should feel uncertain)

### 4. Signal Scorecard

After the interview, score each signal:

**Problem Validation (is this problem real?)**
| Signal | Score (0-2) |
|--------|-------------|
| Described the problem without prompting | |
| Used emotional language about the problem | |
| Has experienced the problem multiple times | |
| Has tried to solve it before | |
| Problem is ongoing, not historical | |

**Willingness to Pay (would they pay to solve it?)**
| Signal | Score (0-2) |
|--------|-------------|
| Currently spending time on this (time = money) | |
| Mentioned cost of the problem unprompted | |
| Asked about your solution | |
| Expressed urgency ("I need to figure this out") | |
| Indicated budget exists for tools | |

**Urgency (how urgent is this?)**
| Signal | Score (0-2) |
|--------|-------------|
| Currently in the problem situation (not "someday") | |
| Has a deadline or constraint driving action | |
| Previous failed attempts make this time different | |
| Consequences of not solving are clear | |

**Fit (are they your target customer?)**
| Signal | Score (0-2) |
|--------|-------------|
| Matches your target profile | |
| Has authority to buy/decide | |
| Problem intensity is high | |
| Could become a champion/reference | |

**Total score:** ___ / 32

- 24+ = Strong signal - follow up, dig deeper
- 16-23 = Moderate signal - worth continuing conversation
- Below 16 = Weak signal - may not be target customer

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Practice the script** - Do a dry run with a friend first. Get comfortable with silence.

2. **Record if possible** - You'll miss things in real-time. Recordings let you re-listen.

3. **Take notes on emotion, not just words** - Did they lean in? Get animated? Sound frustrated?

4. **Follow the energy** - If they light up on a topic, go deeper. Abandon your script if needed.

5. **End with referrals** - "Who else should I talk to?" is the highest-value question.

## Follow-Up Prompts

**"Here are my notes from the interview: [PASTE]. Help me extract the key signals."**

**"This person seemed disengaged. What questions could have gone deeper?"**

**"Adapt this script for a 15-minute version."**

**"I think I led the witness with this question. How do I rephrase it?"**
