# Outreach Engine

A structured system for founders who know they should be talking to customers but don't know where to start.

**Turn outreach from "I should probably talk to people" into a repeatable workflow.**

## What This Is

The Outreach Engine is a collection of prompts, templates, and tracking tools that help you find the right people, craft messages that get responses, and turn conversations into actionable insights.

It doesn't replace the work. It reduces the friction to starting.

**The result:** 10 real conversations this week instead of zero.

## See It Work

**Without structure:**
```
I should probably talk to some potential customers...
*Opens LinkedIn, scrolls, closes tab*
*Repeat for 3 weeks*
```

**With The Outreach Engine:**
```
Day 1: Used The Finder to identify 15 potential customers on LinkedIn and Reddit
Day 2: Sent 5 messages using The Opener templates ("research request" frame)
Day 3: Had first conversation, used The Guide questions
Day 4: Processed notes with The Synthesizer, spotted first pattern
Day 7: 8 conversations completed, clear signal on what to build next
```

That's the shift. Outreach becomes a system, not a guilt trip.

## Quick Start

### 1. Figure out your stage

Are you **pre-product** (validating whether to build) or **post-product** (finding customers for something you've built)?

See [which-stage-am-i.md](./quick-start/which-stage-am-i.md) for the decision tree.

### 2. Send your first message

Follow the 15-minute guide in [your-first-outreach.md](./quick-start/your-first-outreach.md):

1. Pick your stage (validation or acquisition)
2. Use The Finder to identify 3 targets
3. Use The Opener to craft 1 message
4. Send it
5. Track it

That's it. You've started.

### 3. Build momentum

The goal isn't 100 messages. It's 10 real conversations.

One conversation teaches you more than 100 automated messages. The Outreach Engine helps you get to those conversations faster.

## The Five Stages

| Stage | Purpose | What You Get |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **The Finder** | Know who to reach | Search frameworks, platform-specific keywords, qualification criteria |
| **The Opener** | Know what to say | Message templates that frame outreach as research, not sales |
| **The Guide** | Know what to ask | 12 conversation starters that reveal actual needs |
| **The Synthesizer** | Know what you learned | Turn scattered notes into patterns and decisions |
| **The Tracker** | Know you're making progress | Simple system to build momentum toward 10 conversations |

### Stage 1: The Finder

> "Where do my potential customers actually hang out?"

The Finder helps you identify specific people to reach out to. Not "target market segments." Actual humans with names and profiles.

**Use when:** You have a problem in mind but don't know who experiences it, or you know the persona but don't know where to find them.

**Output:** A list of 10-20 qualified targets with context on why they're relevant.

### Stage 2: The Opener

> "What do I say that doesn't feel like spam?"

The Opener provides message templates that reframe cold outreach as research requests. People are more likely to respond when you're asking for insight, not asking for money.

**Use when:** You have targets but you're staring at a blank message field.

**Output:** A personalized message ready to send, tailored to the platform and person.

### Stage 3: The Guide

> "They said yes to a call. Now what?"

The Guide gives you conversation starters and follow-up questions that get people to reveal what they actually need—without leading them to the answer you want to hear.

**Use when:** You've booked a conversation and don't want to waste it.

**Output:** A structured conversation plan with 12 proven questions.

### Stage 4: The Synthesizer

> "I've talked to 5 people. What does it mean?"

The Synthesizer helps you process conversation notes into structured insights. It spots patterns across multiple conversations and helps you decide: pivot, persist, or proceed.

**Use when:** You have raw notes from conversations and need to extract signal.

**Output:** A synthesis document with patterns, contradictions, and recommended next steps.

### Stage 5: The Tracker

> "Am I actually making progress?"

The Tracker is a simple system to log outreach attempts, track responses, and build momentum toward your goal of 10 real conversations.

**Use when:** You need accountability and visibility into your outreach efforts.

**Output:** A clear view of messages sent, responses received, conversations completed.

## Using the Prompts vs Skills

**Prompts (any AI tool):**
- Copy the prompt content and paste into ChatGPT, Claude.ai, or any AI assistant
- Platform-agnostic, works anywhere
- Start here if you're new to AI-assisted workflows

**Skills (Claude Code / advanced):**
- Pre-configured workflows for Claude Code users
- More context-aware, can reference your specific situation
- Use if you're already working in Claude Code

Both approaches get you to the same outcome. Pick whichever fits your workflow.

## Core Principles

### AI augments, humans have conversations

AI is good at:
- Finding where your target customers talk
- Drafting messages that don't sound like templates
- Generating questions that probe without leading
- Spotting patterns across multiple conversations

AI is bad at:
- Actually sitting across from someone and listening
- Reading the pause that means "this is important"
- Building the trust that comes from genuine curiosity

**Use AI for the friction. Do the conversations yourself.**

### Research, not sales

The most effective outreach doesn't ask for anything except time.

> "I'm building something to help [persona] with [problem]. Would you have 15 minutes to share your experience?"

That's not a pitch. It's an invitation. And it works because you're genuinely curious, not performing curiosity to close a deal.

### 10 conversations, not 100 messages

Volume outreach has its place. But for validation, depth beats breadth.

10 real conversations will teach you more than 100 automated LinkedIn messages. The Outreach Engine optimizes for conversations, not touches.

### Progress over perfection

Your first message won't be perfect. Your first conversation will be awkward. That's fine.

The goal is momentum. Send something. Learn. Iterate.

The founders who validate successfully aren't the ones with perfect outreach scripts. They're the ones who actually sent the messages.
