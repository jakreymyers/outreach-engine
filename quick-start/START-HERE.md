## What You Get

The Outreach Engine is a system for having customer conversations without the usual founder paralysis.

**Five components:**

| Component | What It Does | When You Use It |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The Finder** | Identifies specific people to reach | Starting outreach |
| **The Opener** | Crafts messages that get responses | Sending first contact |
| **The Guide** | Provides conversation structure | During calls |
| **The Synthesizer** | Turns notes into insights | After conversations |
| **The Tracker** | Shows your progress | Throughout |

**Two formats:**
- **Prompts** - Copy-paste into any AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- **Skills** - Pre-configured workflows for Claude Code users

Pick whichever fits how you work. Both get you to the same place.

## How It Works

The Outreach Engine removes friction from the parts AI is good at, so you can focus on the part only you can do: having real conversations.

```
Traditional approach:
  "I should talk to customers"
    → [weeks of procrastination]
    → [half-hearted LinkedIn scrolling]
    → [still no conversations]

With Outreach Engine:
  "I should talk to customers"
    → The Finder: "Here are 15 specific people to reach"
    → The Opener: "Here's what to say to each one"
    → You: [send 5 messages]
    → 2 responses come back
    → The Guide: "Here's what to ask them"
    → You: [have 2 actual conversations]
    → The Synthesizer: "Here's what you learned"
    → Repeat until signal is clear
```

The AI handles the prep work. You handle the human work.

## Your First 30 Minutes

### Minutes 1-5: Orient yourself
You're here. Keep reading.

### Minutes 5-10: Determine your stage
Are you:
- **Pre-product?** You're validating whether to build something.
- **Post-product?** You've built something and need customers.

Read [which-stage-am-i.md](./which-stage-am-i.md) if you're not sure. Different stages use the system differently.

### Minutes 10-25: Send your first message
Follow [your-first-outreach.md](./your-first-outreach.md) step by step:
1. Use The Finder to identify 3 targets
2. Use The Opener to craft 1 message
3. Send it
4. Log it in The Tracker

Don't overthink. Don't polish. Just send.

### Minutes 25-30: Set your goal
The target is **10 real conversations** over the next two weeks.

Not 10 messages. Not 10 responses. 10 actual conversations where someone shares their experience with you.

Write this somewhere you'll see it:
> Goal: 10 conversations by [date two weeks from now]

## Navigation Guide

### If you're pre-product (validation)

**Your focus:** Understanding whether the problem you've identified is real and painful enough to build for.

**Start with:**
1. [which-stage-am-i.md](./which-stage-am-i.md) - Confirm you're in validation mode
2. [your-first-outreach.md](./your-first-outreach.md) - Send your first research request
3. `prompts/finder/` - Find more people to talk to
4. `prompts/conversation/` - Prepare for discovery calls

**Key questions to answer:**
- Is this problem real?
- How painful is it (scale of 1-10)?
- What do people currently do about it?
- Would they pay to solve it?

### If you're post-product (acquisition)

**Your focus:** Finding people who have the problem your product solves and starting conversations that might lead to customers.

**Start with:**
1. [which-stage-am-i.md](./which-stage-am-i.md) - Confirm you're in acquisition mode
2. [your-first-outreach.md](./your-first-outreach.md) - Send your first outreach
3. `prompts/finder/` - Build your target list
4. `prompts/opener/` - Craft messages for different platforms

**Key questions to answer:**
- Where do these people hang out?
- What language do they use to describe the problem?
- What's their current solution (competitor or workaround)?
- What would make them switch?

### If you're using Claude Code

The `skills/` folder contains pre-configured workflows that integrate with Claude Code's project context.

**Start with:**
1. Copy `skills/outreach-engine/` to your `.claude/skills/` folder
2. Load the skill: `Load: skills/outreach-engine/SKILL.md`
3. Follow the skill's prompts for guided workflows

The skill knows the system and can walk you through each stage.

**Week 1:**
- 10-15 targets identified
- 5-7 messages sent
- 2-3 responses received
- 1-2 conversations completed

**Week 2:**
- Momentum builds (responses breed confidence)
- 5-8 more conversations completed
- Patterns start to emerge
- You know what to do next

**After 10 conversations:**
- You have real data, not assumptions
- You can articulate the problem in their words
- You know whether to build, pivot, or walk away
- You've started building relationships with potential customers

## Common Questions

**"What if nobody responds?"**

That's signal too. Either your message needs work, your targeting is off, or the problem isn't as pressing as you thought. The Synthesizer helps you figure out which.

**"What if I don't know what problem to solve?"**

Start broader. Reach out to people in your target industry and ask: "What's the most frustrating part of your work right now?" The Finder can help you identify relevant communities even without a specific problem hypothesis.

**"Isn't this just cold outreach? I hate cold outreach."**

It's not cold when you're genuinely curious. The difference is intent. You're not trying to sell them anything. You're trying to understand their world. People can tell the difference.

**"I'm an introvert. This sounds exhausting."**

Good news: text-based outreach is perfectly valid. LinkedIn messages, Reddit comments, email—none of it requires being on a Zoom call if you don't want to. Written responses still count as conversations.

## Ready?

Go to [your-first-outreach.md](./your-first-outreach.md) and send your first message.

Right now. Not tomorrow.

The system only works if you use it.
