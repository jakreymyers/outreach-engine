# Your First Outreach

**Time required:** 15 minutes
**Output:** 1 message sent, logged, and done

Stop reading guides. Send something. This document walks you through it.

---

## Before You Start

**You need:**
- [ ] A problem you're exploring (even if vague)
- [ ] A platform to reach people (LinkedIn, Reddit, X, email)
- [ ] 15 uninterrupted minutes

**You don't need:**
- A perfect message
- Certainty about your idea
- A pitch deck or demo

Let's go.

---

## Step 1: Pick Your Stage (2 minutes)

Quick gut check:

| If this sounds like you... | You're in... |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| "I have an idea and want to know if it's worth building" | **Validation** |
| "I built something and need to find customers" | **Acquisition** |

Not sure? Read [which-stage-am-i.md](./which-stage-am-i.md). But for now, just pick one and move on.

---

## Step 2: Find 3 Targets with The Finder (5 minutes)

Open your AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, whatever you use) and paste this prompt:

### For Validation:

```
I'm exploring an idea and need to find people to talk to.

The problem I'm investigating: [DESCRIBE YOUR PROBLEM IN 1-2 SENTENCES]

The type of person who might have this problem: [DESCRIBE THE PERSONA]

Help me find 3 specific places to find these people:
1. One LinkedIn search strategy (what keywords, what filters)
2. One Reddit community or thread type to look for
3. One other platform where they might be active (X, Indie Hackers, Hacker News, Slack communities, etc.)

For each, give me:
- Specific search terms or community names
- What to look for to identify good targets
- A signal that someone is worth reaching out to
```

### For Acquisition:

```
I have a product that solves [PROBLEM] for [PERSONA].

Help me find 3 specific places to find potential customers:
1. One LinkedIn search strategy (what keywords, what filters, what signals of need)
2. One community where they discuss this problem
3. One content type or thread where they reveal they have this problem

For each, give me:
- Specific search terms or community names
- Signals that someone is a good fit
- How to identify people who are actively looking for solutions
```

**Run the prompt. Get your targets. Pick the easiest platform to start.**

For most people, that's LinkedIn. You don't need permission to DM, and professional context makes outreach feel less weird.

---

## Step 3: Identify 3 Specific People (3 minutes)

Go to the platform and find 3 real humans who fit your target.

**What to look for:**
- Recent activity (posted or commented in last month)
- Relevant role or background
- Some evidence they care about the problem area

**Don't overthink this.** You're not committing to anything. You're finding 3 people to practice on.

Write down:
1. Name: _____________ | Platform: _____________ | Why they might be relevant: _____________
2. Name: _____________ | Platform: _____________ | Why they might be relevant: _____________
3. Name: _____________ | Platform: _____________ | Why they might be relevant: _____________

## Step 4: Craft 1 Message with The Opener (4 minutes)

Pick ONE person from your list. The one who feels most approachable.

Open your AI tool and paste this prompt:

### For Validation:

```
I want to reach out to someone for a research conversation.

About them:
- Name: [NAME]
- Platform: [PLATFORM]
- Their background: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- Why I think they're relevant: [YOUR NOTES]

About my research:
- Problem I'm exploring: [YOUR PROBLEM]
- What I'm trying to learn: [YOUR QUESTIONS]

Write a short message (under 100 words) that:
- Acknowledges something specific about them
- Frames this as research, not sales
- Asks for 15 minutes of their time
- Makes it easy to say yes or no

Keep it casual and genuine. No salesy language.
```

### For Acquisition:

```
I want to reach out to a potential customer.

About them:
- Name: [NAME]
- Platform: [PLATFORM]
- Their background: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- Signal they might need this: [YOUR NOTES]

About my product:
- Problem it solves: [PROBLEM]
- Who it's for: [PERSONA]

Write a short message (under 100 words) that:
- Acknowledges something specific about them
- Briefly mentions what I'm building and why it's relevant
- Asks if they'd be open to a quick conversation
- Doesn't push for a demo or sale

Keep it conversational. Not a pitch.
```

**Read the output. Edit it to sound like you. Remove anything that feels off.**

---

## Step 5: Send It (30 seconds)

Copy the message. Open the platform. Paste. Send.

Don't re-read it 5 times. Don't add "just following up." Don't wait until tomorrow.

**Send it now.**

---

## Step 6: Log It (1 minute)

Create a simple tracker. This can be a note, a spreadsheet, or just a text file.

```
OUTREACH LOG
============

Date: [TODAY]
Name: [WHO YOU MESSAGED]
Platform: [WHERE]
Stage: [VALIDATION / ACQUISITION]
Message sent: [PASTE YOUR MESSAGE]
Status: SENT

---

[Add more as you go]
```

That's it. You've started.

---

## What Happens Next

### If they respond:

Great. Move to The Guide for conversation prep:
- For validation: Focus on understanding their problem
- For acquisition: Focus on understanding their needs and fit

### If they don't respond:

Normal. Most outreach doesn't get responses. The goal is volume over time.

Send to person #2 and #3 from your list. Then find 3 more.

**Response rates:**
- LinkedIn DMs: 10-30% is good
- Cold email: 5-15% is good
- Reddit comments: Varies wildly

Don't judge yourself by one message. Judge by 10.

### If they say "not interested":

Also fine. That's data. Log it and move on.

A "no" is better than silence. At least you know.

## Your Momentum Goal

You just sent 1 message. Here's what the next two weeks look like:

| Day | Target | Cumulative |
|-----|--------|------------|
| Day 1 (today) | 1 message | 1 |
| Day 2-3 | 4 more messages | 5 |
| Day 4-7 | 5 more messages | 10 |
| Day 8-14 | 10 more messages | 20 |

From 20 messages, you should get 3-6 responses. From those, 2-4 conversations.

That's progress. That's validation in action.

---

## Stuck? Common Blockers

**"I don't know what problem to explore."**
Reach out anyway. Ask: "What's the most frustrating part of your work right now?" You're doing discovery at the market level, not the problem level. Still valuable.

**"My message doesn't feel right."**
Send it anyway. Your first message won't be perfect. Neither will your second. The only way to improve is to see what gets responses.

**"What if they think I'm wasting their time?"**
Most people like being asked for their perspective. You're not asking for money. You're asking for insight. That's flattering, not annoying.

**"I'm nervous."**
Good. That means it matters to you. Send anyway. The nervousness fades after the first few.

**"What if they say yes and I don't know what to ask?"**
The Guide has 12 conversation starters. You'll be fine. But cross that bridge when you get there. First, send the message.

## Recap

1. [x] Picked your stage (validation or acquisition)
2. [x] Used The Finder to identify 3 targets
3. [x] Used The Opener to craft 1 message
4. [x] Sent it
5. [x] Logged it

**Congratulations.** You just did more customer outreach than most founders do in a month.

Now do it again tomorrow.

---

## Next Steps

- **Tomorrow:** Send 2 more messages to people from your target list
- **This week:** Get to 10 total messages sent
- **When someone responds:** Use The Guide to prepare for the conversation
- **After conversations:** Use The Synthesizer to extract insights

The system works. But only if you keep sending.

Go.
