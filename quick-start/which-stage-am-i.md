# Which Stage Am I?

Before you start outreach, figure out what you're trying to learn. Your stage determines how you use the system.

---

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you have a product people can use?
│
├── NO → You're in VALIDATION
│        (Figuring out what to build)
│
└── YES → You're in ACQUISITION
          (Finding customers for what you built)
```

That's the core question. Everything else follows from that.

---

## Stage 1: Validation (Pre-Product)

**You're here if:**
- You have an idea but haven't built it yet
- You've built something but nobody's using it
- You're not sure if the problem is real or painful enough
- You want to avoid building the wrong thing

**Your goal:** Understand whether to build, what to build, and for whom.

**What you're asking in conversations:**
- Is this problem real?
- How painful is it? (Get them to quantify)
- What have you tried? What didn't work?
- Would you pay for a solution? How much?
- Who else has this problem?

**How you use the Outreach Engine:**

| Stage | Your Focus |
|-------|------------|
| **The Finder** | Find people who might have the problem you're investigating |
| **The Opener** | Frame outreach as "research"—you're learning, not selling |
| **The Guide** | Focus on problem validation questions, not product feedback |
| **The Synthesizer** | Look for patterns about the problem, not reactions to your idea |
| **The Tracker** | Track conversations toward "10 conversations before building" |

**Validation paths through the system:**

```
Path A: Problem-first validation
────────────────────────────────
You have a hunch about a problem but aren't sure it's real.

1. The Finder → Search for communities where people discuss this problem
2. The Opener → "I'm researching how [persona] deals with [problem area]"
3. The Guide → Open-ended questions about their experience
4. The Synthesizer → Is the problem real? How painful? Worth solving?
5. Decision: Build, pivot the problem, or walk away

Path B: Solution-first validation
────────────────────────────────
You have an idea for a product and want to test if anyone needs it.

1. The Finder → Search for people who might be the target user
2. The Opener → "I'm exploring an idea and would love your perspective"
3. The Guide → Focus on their current workflow and pain points
4. The Synthesizer → Does your solution address a real problem?
5. Decision: Build, pivot the solution, or walk away

Path C: Market-first validation
────────────────────────────────
You want to build something for a specific market but don't know what.

1. The Finder → Find active participants in that market/community
2. The Opener → "I want to understand what's frustrating in [market]"
3. The Guide → Broad questions about pain points and unmet needs
4. The Synthesizer → What problems keep coming up? Which are solvable?
5. Decision: Pick a problem to solve, or choose a different market
```

**Warning signs you're still in validation (even if you think you're not):**
- You've built something but have fewer than 5 paying customers
- Most of your "users" are friends or family
- You haven't had 10 real conversations with strangers who fit your persona
- You're not confident you can describe the problem in their words

---

## Stage 2: Acquisition (Post-Product)

**You're here if:**
- You have a product that works
- You have some early customers (even just a few)
- You know the problem is real because people are paying you
- You need to find more of those people

**Your goal:** Find and convert customers who have the problem you solve.

**What you're asking in conversations:**
- Do you have this problem?
- How are you solving it today?
- What would make you switch to something new?
- What would you need to see to try this?
- Who else in your network has this problem?

**How you use the Outreach Engine:**

| Stage | Your Focus |
|-------|------------|
| **The Finder** | Find people who likely have the problem you solve |
| **The Opener** | Frame outreach as "sharing something relevant"—soft sell |
| **The Guide** | Focus on fit and objection questions |
| **The Synthesizer** | Look for conversion patterns and common objections |
| **The Tracker** | Track pipeline from outreach to demo to customer |

**Acquisition paths through the system:**

```
Path A: Cold outreach to strangers
──────────────────────────────────
You're reaching out to people who don't know you exist.

1. The Finder → Build a list of qualified prospects
2. The Opener → "I noticed you [signal]. We help with [problem]..."
3. The Guide → Qualify their fit and pain level
4. The Synthesizer → What objections keep coming up?
5. Iterate on messaging based on what works

Path B: Warm outreach to communities
────────────────────────────────────
You're engaging in communities where your customers hang out.

1. The Finder → Identify specific communities and active members
2. The Opener → Provide value first, then soft mention your solution
3. The Guide → Focus on understanding their specific situation
4. The Synthesizer → What community language resonates?
5. Build reputation, then reach out directly

Path C: Referral expansion
──────────────────────────
You're asking existing customers for introductions.

1. The Finder → Identify your best customers and their networks
2. The Opener → "Would you be open to introducing me to..."
3. The Guide → Understand who else in their world has this problem
4. The Synthesizer → Which customer types refer the most?
5. Build systematic referral process
```

**Warning signs you might need to go back to validation:**
- Your "customers" stop using the product after a month
- You can't explain why someone chose you over alternatives
- Every conversation surfaces a different "most important" problem
- You're getting demos but not conversions (product-market fit issue)

## Not Sure? Use This Checklist

Answer honestly:

| Question | Yes = Acquisition | No = Validation |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Do you have paying customers (not friends/family)? | | |
| Can you describe the problem in your customer's exact words? | | |
| Do you know why customers chose you over alternatives? | | |
| Have you had 10+ conversations with strangers who fit your persona? | | |
| Could you confidently recommend your product to a friend with the problem? | | |

**Mostly "Yes"?** You're in Acquisition. Focus on finding more customers.

**Mostly "No"?** You're in Validation. Focus on understanding the problem.

**Mixed?** You might need to validate before you scale. It's okay to step back.

## What If I'm In Between?

Some founders are in a gray zone:
- Built something, got a few users, not sure if it's working
- Had some conversations, got mixed signals
- Multiple ideas, not sure which to pursue

**If this is you, default to Validation.**

It's better to spend 2 weeks in validation conversations than 6 months building something nobody wants.

The Outreach Engine works for both stages. But it works better when you know which questions to ask.

## Next Step

Now that you know your stage, go to [your-first-outreach.md](./your-first-outreach.md) and send your first message.

The prompts and templates are labeled by stage. Pick the ones that match where you are.
