> Pre-product founder validating an AI fitness app idea

---

**Name:** Maya Chen

**Background:**
- Software engineer at a fintech startup (3 years)
- Fitness enthusiast - runs, lifts, does yoga
- Built a few side projects, nothing that took off
- Active on Reddit fitness communities
- First-time founder

**Day job situation:**
- Full-time employed, building this on nights/weekends

- Can't quit without validation

**Technical ability:**
- Can build the entire product herself
- Previous experience with React Native, Python
- Has used AI APIs before

## The Idea

**One-liner:** An AI workout planner that adapts to your daily energy levels and life circumstances.

**Problem statement:**
Workout apps give you a rigid plan. But life isn't rigid. Some days you're exhausted. Some days you only have 20 minutes. Some days you're traveling. Current apps don't adapt - they make you feel like a failure when you can't follow the plan.

**Solution vision:**
Every morning, you tell the app how you're feeling (energy, time available, equipment access). The AI adjusts your workout for the day while keeping you on track toward your goals over time.

**Target user:**
Busy professionals (25-45) who want to stay fit but struggle with consistency because life gets in the way.

**Founder-problem fit:**
Maya IS this person. She's skipped workouts because the app said "60 min legs" and she only had 30 minutes. Then she felt guilty and skipped the next day too.

## Why This Might Work

- Growing AI fitness market
- Clear pain point Maya has experienced herself
- Differentiated from rigid workout apps
- Could start simple (just the planning) and expand

## Why This Might Fail

- Consumer willingness to pay for fitness apps is notoriously low
- Lots of competition (Nike, Peloton, etc.)
- "Adapting to energy" is subjective and hard to measure
- Retention is brutal in fitness apps

---

## Validation Goals

**Primary question:**
Will busy professionals pay for an adaptive workout app?

**Secondary questions:**
1. How do people currently handle the "I don't have energy/time today" problem?
2. What's the trigger that makes someone skip a workout?
3. Have they tried other solutions? What failed?
4. What would make them switch from their current app?
5. Price sensitivity - would they pay $10/mo? $20/mo? More?

**Success criteria:**
- 10 conversations with target users
- 7+ confirm the problem is real
- 3+ say they'd pay for a solution
- Clear pattern in what "adaptive" means to them

**Failure criteria:**
- <3 people confirm the problem
- Everyone says "that would be nice" with no urgency
- Can't find people willing to talk
- Price sensitivity is near zero

---

## Constraints

**Time:** 10-15 hours/week for 3 weeks

**Budget:** $0 (can't spend money until validated)

**Resources:**
- Reddit accounts (active in r/fitness, r/xxfitness)
- LinkedIn (mostly fintech connections, not fitness)
- No Twitter presence
- No existing audience

**Non-negotiables:**
- Won't build anything until 10 conversations
- Will be honest about being a founder doing research
- Won't pitch - just learn

## Maya's Mindset Going In

**Excited about:**
- Finally working on something she cares about
- Solving her own problem
- Potentially helping people get fit

**Worried about:**
- Reaching out to strangers feels weird
- What if the idea is stupid?
- What if no one cares?
- Competition from big players

**Assumptions she knows she's making:**
- "Other people have this problem, not just me"
- "People will pay for a solution"
- "AI adaptation is the key differentiator"
- "Busy professionals are the right segment"
