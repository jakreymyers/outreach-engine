> Communities identified, signals found, and 10 targets selected

## Communities Identified

Maya used the Finder skill with this input:

```
Problem: Workout apps are too rigid - they don't adapt when you're tired, short on time, or traveling

Target customer: Busy professionals (25-45) who want to stay fit but struggle with consistency

Goal: Find where these people talk about workout planning and fitness struggles
```

### Primary Communities Found

| Community | Platform | Size | Signal Quality | Notes |
|-----------|----------|------|----------------|-------|
| r/fitness | Reddit | 11M members | Medium | High volume, can filter for relevant posts |
| r/xxfitness | Reddit | 800K members | High | More personal, lots of struggle posts |
| r/homegym | Reddit | 900K members | Medium | Different angle - they've invested in fitness |
| r/bodyweightfitness | Reddit | 2.5M members | Medium | Good for "low equipment" angle |
| Fitness Twitter | Twitter | N/A | Low | Hard to find non-influencers |

### Secondary Communities (Lower Volume, Higher Signal)

| Community | Platform | Signal Quality | Notes |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-------|
| r/EOOD (Exercise Out of Depression) | Reddit | High | Smaller but very engaged |
| r/running | Reddit | Medium | Specific but passionate |
| Various fitness Discords | Discord | High | Hard to access as outsider |
| Peloton Facebook groups | Facebook | Medium | Already paying for fitness |

1. **r/xxfitness** - Best signal-to-noise for her target

| 2 | u/techwannabejacked | Tech worker, complained about energy fluctuations | Founder-similar profile | Reddit |

### What Maya Looked For in Post History

Before adding someone to the list:
- Are they actually a busy professional? (job mentions, life context)
- Are they genuine (not a fitness influencer or trainer)?
- Have they posted recently (active user)?
- Do they engage in discussion (not just venting)?
- Do they seem like someone who'd respond to a DM?

### Rejected Candidates

| Username | Why Rejected |
|----------|--------------|
| u/gymshark_ambassador | Too fitness-influencer |
| u/personaltrainer_mike | Wrong target (provider not customer) |
| u/fitnessnewbie2024 | Too new to fitness - different problem |
| u/bodybuilding_pro | Too serious - not target market |
