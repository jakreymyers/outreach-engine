# Opener Messages: Maya's Outreach

> Messages sent, responses received, and what Maya learned about messaging

---

## Messaging Strategy

Maya decided to use the **Research Request** frame for most outreach, with one **Peer Connection** variation to test.

**Key principles she followed:**
- Lead with what THEY said, not what she wants
- Make it clear this is research, not a pitch
- Keep it short (under 100 words)
- Make saying yes easy (low commitment ask)
- Be honest about being a founder

---

## Message Templates Used

### Template A: Research Request

```
Hey [Name],

I saw your post/comment about [specific thing they said]. It really resonated with me.

I'm a software engineer exploring an idea around adaptive workout planning - basically, an app that adjusts to your energy and life instead of making you feel guilty for not following a rigid plan.

I'm not building anything yet - just trying to understand if this is a real problem or just me.

Would you be up for a 15-min chat about your experience? No pitch, just questions. I'm genuinely trying to learn.

Either way, thanks for the post - it validated something I've been feeling.

[Maya]
```

### Template B: Peer Connection

```
Hey [Name],

Fellow [tech worker/parent/runner] here. Your comment about [specific frustration] hit close to home.

I've been thinking about building something to solve this for myself, but before I write any code, I want to make sure I'm not the only one with this problem.

Any chance you'd do a quick 15-min call to help me understand your experience? Not selling anything - genuinely just trying to learn.

[Maya]
```

### Template C: Question-First (Tested once)

```
Hey [Name],

Quick question - when you [mentioned skipping workouts / said programs don't adapt / talked about energy], what would have made it easier to stay on track?

Trying to understand this problem better. Would love to hear your take.

[Maya]
```

| 2 | u/devgirlgains | B (Peer) | **Yes - 2 days** | "Sure, fellow dev here. DM me your calendar" |
| 3 | u/fitnessmom_3kids | A (Research) | No response | Followed up after 4 days, still no response |

**Response rate: 66% (2/3)**

### Batch 2: Secondary Prospects

| # | Target | Template | Response? | Notes |
|---|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 4 | u/techwannabejacked | A (Research) | **Yes - 1 day** | "Are you selling something? If not, sure" |
| 5 | u/busylawyerlifts | A (Research) | No response | |
| 6 | u/exhaustedbutlifting | B (Peer) | **Yes - same day** | "This is literally my life. Happy to help" |

**Response rate: 50% (2/4)**

### Batch 3: Backup Prospects

| # | Target | Template | Response? | Notes |
|---|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| 7 | u/recoveringperfection | A (Research) | **Yes - 3 days** | Longer response, clearly thought about it |
| 8 | u/homegym_dad | B (Peer) | No response | |

## Overall Response Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Messages sent | 10 |
| Responses (any) | 7 |
| Agreed to call | 6 |
| Calls completed | 5 |
| Response rate | 70% |
| Call conversion | 50% (of messages sent) |

### What Worked

**Specific references to their posts:**
> "I saw your post about giving up on PPL programs..."

This got way better responses than generic messages. People responded because they felt seen.

**Honesty about being a founder:**
One person (u/techwannabejacked) specifically asked "are you selling something?" Maya's honesty that she's exploring an idea but NOT pitching converted them.

**Low commitment ask:**
"15 minutes" felt easy to say yes to. No one pushed back on time.

**Peer angle:**
Template B (Peer Connection) performed well because it established common ground before the ask.

### What Didn't Work

**u/fitnessmom_3kids - No response despite strong fit:**
Maya's theory: The "mom" audience might be more protective of their time, OR she's gotten too many DMs already.

**u/busylawyerlifts - No response:**
Post history showed they don't engage with DMs much. Should have checked this first.

**u/consultantcardio - Partial response:**
Template C (Question-First) got an answer but didn't convert to a call. The person answered the question and was done.

**Lesson learned:** Questions alone don't build enough relationship for a call commitment.

### Response Timing

| Response Time | Count |
|---------------|-------|
| Same day | 3 |
| 1 day | 2 |
| 2-3 days | 2 |
| 4+ days | 0 |
| Never | 3 |

**Insight:** If they're going to respond, it usually happens within 3 days. After that, move on.

## Follow-up Messages

Maya sent one follow-up to non-responders after 4-5 days:

**Follow-up template:**
```
Hey [Name], just bumping this in case it got buried. No worries if you're too busy - I know DMs can pile up. If you do have 15 min sometime, would love to learn from your experience. Either way, thanks!
```

**Results:**
- u/fitnessmom_3kids: Still no response
- u/busylawyerlifts: Still no response
- u/homegym_dad: Still no response

**Conclusion:** Follow-up didn't convert anyone who hadn't responded initially. Maya decided to focus energy on new prospects rather than chasing non-responders.

## Messaging Learnings

### For Next Time

1. **Check post history for DM engagement** before messaging
2. **Peer connection angle** works better than pure research frame
3. **Question-first** gets answers but not relationships
4. **Specificity is everything** - reference exact words they used
5. **Parents might need different approach** - lower response rate

### Message Evolution

Maya's first message was 127 words. By message 10, she'd trimmed to 89 words.

**What she cut:**
- Background about herself
- Extra explanation of the idea
- Multiple questions at the end

**What she kept:**
- Reference to their specific post
- Clear but brief problem statement
- Simple ask
- Honesty about stage

### Red Flag Responses

One response that seemed good but wasn't:

> "This sounds cool! I'd definitely use that. You should build it!"

This person seemed enthusiastic but canceled the call twice. Maya learned: **Enthusiasm in a DM =/= commitment to a conversation.**
