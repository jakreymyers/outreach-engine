# Example Scenarios

> Three founders. Three different contexts. Real validation journeys with all the mess included.

---

## Why Examples Matter

Templates are useful. But seeing how someone actually used them? That's where learning happens.

These scenarios show complete validation journeys - the outreach that worked, the outreach that flopped, the conversations that changed direction, and the decisions that emerged.

They're messy on purpose. Real validation isn't clean.

## The Three Scenarios

### 1. Maya - B2C SaaS Validation

**[maya-fitness-app/](./maya-fitness-app/)**

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Founder** | Maya Chen, software engineer at a fintech startup |
| **Idea** | AI workout planner that adapts to daily energy levels |
| **Stage** | Pre-product (idea only) |
| **Validation Goal** | Determine if consumers will pay for adaptive workout planning |

**Why this example:**
- Classic B2C consumer app idea
- Strong founder-problem fit (she's the target user)
- Community-based outreach (Reddit, fitness communities)
- Demonstrates what happens when the problem is real but willingness to pay is low
- Shows a pivot decision

**Key learnings:**
- Consumer apps face willingness-to-pay challenges
- "I want this" is not "I'll pay for this"
- Pivot signals and how to recognize them
- The difference between validation and market research

### 2. Derek - B2B Tool Acquisition

**[derek-b2b-tool/](./derek-b2b-tool/)**

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Founder** | Derek Morrison, former PM, now full-time founder |
| **Idea** | Analytics dashboard for small e-commerce stores |
| **Stage** | Post-product (working MVP with 5 beta users) |
| **Validation Goal** | Find first 100 paying customers |

**Why this example:**
- B2B SaaS context
- Post-product validation (product exists, need customers)
- LinkedIn-based outreach to business operators
- Value-first approach (free audit offer)
- Shows how to convert a conversation into a customer

**Key learnings:**
- B2B requires different messaging than B2C
- Value-first openers can drive high response rates
- Discovery calls reveal product opportunities
- The path from conversation to paying customer

### 3. Sam - Two-Sided Marketplace Validation

**[sam-marketplace/](./sam-marketplace/)**

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Founder** | Sam Torres, freelance designer with large Twitter following |
| **Idea** | Marketplace connecting freelance designers with startups |
| **Stage** | Pre-product (concept only) |
| **Validation Goal** | Validate both supply (designers) and demand (startups) sides |

**Why this example:**
- Marketplace complexity (two customer segments)
- Leverages existing audience for outreach
- Different validation approach for each side
- Shows how supply/demand signals can conflict
- Demonstrates building one side first strategy

**Key learnings:**
- Marketplaces require validating both sides
- Different messaging for different customer types
- Supply and demand have different priorities
- Sometimes you build supply first, sometimes demand first
- Quality signals matter more than you expect

## How to Use These Examples

### If You're Pre-Product (Like Maya and Sam)

Focus on:
- How they found people to talk to
- What questions revealed real vs. fake interest
- How they recognized pivot signals
- The synthesis process that led to decisions

### If You're Post-Product (Like Derek)

Focus on:
- The value-first opener approach
- How discovery calls differ from validation calls
- Converting conversations into customers
- Following up without being annoying

### If You're Building a Marketplace (Like Sam)

Focus on:
- Validating sides separately
- Different interview scripts for each side
- Identifying which side to build first
- Quality vs. quantity signals

## File Structure

Each scenario contains:

```
[founder-name]/
├── scenario.md           # Background, idea, goals, constraints
├── finder-output.md      # Communities found, targets identified
├── opener-messages.md    # Messages sent, responses received
├── conversation-transcript.md  # Full example conversation
└── synthesis.md          # Analysis, patterns, decision
```

---

## What Makes These Examples Realistic

**They include failures.** Messages that got no response. Conversations that went nowhere. Assumptions that were wrong.

**They show uncertainty.** Real validation involves doubt. These examples capture the moments of "I'm not sure what this means."

**They don't have clean endings.** Maya's pivot is a question mark. Derek closes one customer but the product needs work. Sam is still figuring out supply vs. demand.

**The numbers are real-ish.** Response rates, conversion rates, and patterns reflect what actually happens in outreach, not idealized scenarios.

---

## Reading Order

If you're new to validation:

1. **Start with Maya** - Cleanest example of the full cycle
2. **Then Sam** - See how complexity changes the process
3. **Then Derek** - See how post-product differs

If you know the basics:

Jump to whichever scenario matches your situation.

---

## Important Caveats

**These are illustrative examples, not guaranteed playbooks.** Your market, your customers, your product - they'll all be different. Use these to understand the process, not to copy the specific approach.

**The "right" decisions vary.** Maya pivots, Derek persists, Sam pauses. All of these could be wrong in a different context. The point is HOW they made decisions, not WHAT decisions they made.

**These are compressed timelines.** Real validation takes weeks or months. These examples compress that into readable narratives.
