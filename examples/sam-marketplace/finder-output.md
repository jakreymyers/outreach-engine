> Finding designers (supply) and startups (demand) for marketplace validation

## Supply Side: Designers

### Target Designer Profile

**Ideal designer:**
- Freelance or considering freelance
- 3+ years experience
- Has worked with startups before
- Based in US/UK/Canada/Western Europe (for rate compatibility)
- Quality portfolio
- Struggling with client acquisition (not already booked solid)

**Disqualified:**
- Full-time employed with no freelance interest
- Junior designers (< 2 years)
- Agency owners (different needs)
- Design influencers with huge followings (don't need help finding clients)
- Pure visual/graphic designers (need product/UX focus)

### Finding Designers

Sam used multiple channels:

#### Channel 1: Personal Network

**Approach:** DM designers she knows personally

**Results:** Identified 12 designers from her network who fit the profile

| Name | Relationship | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Priya | Former colleague | Went freelance last year, complains about client quality |
| Marcus | Met at conference | Great portfolio, inconsistent work |
| Elena | Design community friend | Actively seeking better clients |
| Jordan | Friend of friend | Referenced by Priya |
| And 8 more... | | |

**Quality:** High - Sam knows their work

#### Channel 2: Twitter Network

**Approach:** Post asking for DMs from designers interested in talking about freelance challenges

**Tweet:**
> "Working on something for freelance designers. If you do product/UX work for startups and finding good clients is harder than it should be, DM me? Want to learn about your experience. Not selling anything - genuinely researching."

**Results:**
- 47 DMs received
- ~20 qualified after reviewing portfolios
- Selected 8 for conversations

**Quality:** Medium-high - needed portfolio review to filter

#### Channel 3: Design Communities

**Communities checked:**
- Designership Slack
- Designer Hangout Discord
- ADPList (mentor profiles)
- Dribbble Pro network

**Approach:** Browsed profiles, checked who mentions "freelance" and "available"

**Results:** Identified 10 potential targets

**Quality:** Medium - harder to assess without personal connection

### Final Designer Target List

|---|------|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Priya | Personal | Former colleague, knows her work | High |
| 2 | Marcus | Personal | Strong portfolio, talked about client issues | High |

## Demand Side: Startups

### Target Startup Profile

**Ideal startup:**
- Early stage (Seed to Series A)
- Has hired freelance designers before OR needs to soon
- Product-focused (not services/consulting)
- Budget for design ($5K+ per project minimum)
- Founder or hiring manager accessible

**Disqualified:**
- Enterprise companies (different procurement)
- Agencies (competitors, not customers)
- Very early (idea stage, no budget)
- Non-product companies (won't value design same way)

### Finding Startups

#### Channel 1: Personal Network

**Approach:** Reach out to founders Sam has worked with

**Results:** 8 founders from past clients or personal connections

| Dana | Health tech | Seed | Complained about bad designer hire |
| Omar | SaaS tool | Pre-seed | Just starting to think about design |
| And 5 more... | | | |

#### Channel 2: Twitter Network

**Approach:** Search for founders who've tweeted about design hiring challenges

**Search queries:**
- "looking for designer" (filter to followers/following)
- "bad experience with upwork"
- "need design help"
- "freelance designer recommendations"

**Results:** Found 15 relevant tweets from founders, 7 seemed approachable

#### Channel 3: Startup Communities

**Communities:**
- Indie Hackers (forum posts about design)
- YC Slack alumni network (Sam has access through past YC startup)
- Twitter startup community

**Approach:** Look for posts about design challenges or hiring frustrations

**Results:** Identified 5 founders from posts

|---|------|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Chris | Fintech | Personal | Past client, hires designers often | High |
| 2 | Dana | Health tech | Personal | Bad hire experience, vented to Sam | High |

## Channel Comparison

| Channel | Supply (Designers) | Demand (Startups) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Personal network | Best quality, limited quantity | Best quality, limited quantity |
| Twitter | Good quality, good quantity | Medium quality, good quantity |
| Communities | Medium quality, variable | Medium quality, variable |

**Insight:** Sam's Twitter following is a major asset. She can reach both sides, though designers are more accessible (her primary audience).

## Outreach Sequencing

### Why Supply First

Sam decided to validate designers before startups:

1. **Access:** More designers in her network/audience
2. **Expertise:** Can assess designer quality directly
3. **Dependency:** If designers won't join, demand is irrelevant
4. **Learning:** Designer conversations will inform what to tell startups

### The Plan

**Week 1-2: Supply Validation**
- Message 10 designers
- Have 8+ conversations
- Assess: Will quality designers join? At what terms?

**Week 3-4: Demand Validation**
- Message 8 startups
- Have 6+ conversations
- Assess: Will startups pay premium? What do they need to see?

## Different Questions for Different Sides

### Questions for Designers (Supply)

1. How do you currently find clients?
2. What makes a client "good" vs. "bad"?
3. What would make you join a new platform?
4. How do you feel about a 15-20% take rate?
5. What would make you stay vs. go direct?

### Questions for Startups (Demand)

1. How do you currently find designers?
2. What's gone wrong with past hires?
3. What would make you trust a new marketplace?
4. What's your typical budget for design projects?
5. Would you pay more for vetted/curated talent?

## Risks Identified in Research

### Supply Side Risks

1. **Designers won't accept take rate** - They're used to keeping 100%
2. **Good designers don't need help** - Only struggling designers join
3. **Platform leakage** - Go direct after first project

### Demand Side Risks

1. **Startups won't pay premium** - Upwork pricing anchors them low
2. **Trust is hard to build** - New platform, why try it?
3. **Budget constraints** - Early startups are cheap

### Questions to Address

These risks will guide Sam's interview questions. She's not trying to validate her idea - she's trying to find the holes in it.
