# Opener Messages: Sam's Two-Sided Outreach

> Different messaging for designers (supply) vs. startups (demand)

---

## Supply Side: Designer Outreach

### Strategy

Sam used three approaches for designers:

1. **Personal network:** Direct ask, leverage relationship
2. **Twitter DMs:** Research frame, reference their content
3. **Community:** Softer ask, build relationship first

### Template: Personal Network

```
Hey [Name]!

Been thinking about the freelance designer life lately. I'm exploring an idea around making it easier for quality designers to find good startup clients (and vice versa).

Would love to pick your brain about your experience finding clients. Not a pitch - I'm still in research mode and genuinely want to understand what's working and what's not for you.

30 min call this week or next? I'll buy you a virtual coffee.
```

### Template: Twitter DMs

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your tweet about [specific thing - freelance struggles / client issues / etc.]. Really resonated.

I'm researching something around freelance designers + startups - trying to understand what makes finding good clients so hard.

Would you be up for a 20-min chat? I'm not selling anything, just learning. Happy to share what I find after if it's useful.
```

### Template: Community Outreach

```
Hey [Name],

Noticed your post in [community] about [topic]. Fellow product designer here - I've been freelancing for 6 years and the client acquisition part never gets easier.

Working on understanding this problem better. Would love to hear about your experience if you're open to it. No pitch, just research.

Either way, your work looks great. Followed your portfolio.
```

## Demand Side: Startup Outreach

### Strategy

Different approach for startups:

1. **Personal network:** Leverage past client relationships
2. **Twitter:** Reference their hiring/design challenges
3. **Communities:** Respond to existing posts about design

### Template: Personal Network (Past Clients)

```
Hey [Name]!

Hope [Company] is going well. I've been thinking about the founder-designer connection a lot lately.

You've hired designers a few times now - I'm curious what that experience has been like. The good, the bad, the frustrating.

I'm exploring building something in this space and would value your perspective. 20 min to catch up and hear your honest take?

No pitch - just learning.
```

### Template: Twitter DMs (Founders)

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your tweet about [design struggle / hiring challenge / Upwork frustration]. I've been on the designer side of this equation for years, and I think there's a real problem on both sides.

Would love to hear more about your experience. 15-20 min call? I'm researching whether there's a better way to connect startups with quality design talent.

Not a pitch - genuinely learning.
```

### Template: Community (Responding to Posts)

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your post about [design challenge]. This is exactly what I've been researching.

I spent 6 years as a freelance designer working with startups. Now I'm exploring whether there's a better way to connect the two sides.

Would you be open to a quick chat about your experience? I'm trying to understand where the current options (Upwork, referrals, etc.) fall short.
```

## Messaging Differences: Supply vs. Demand

### What Sam Noticed

**Designers responded to:**
- Acknowledgment of the client acquisition problem
- Sam's credibility as a fellow designer
- "Not a pitch" framing
- Genuine curiosity about their experience

**Startups responded to:**
- Reference to their specific pain (bad hires, Upwork frustrations)
- Sam's positioning as designer who understands both sides
- "Not a pitch" framing (same as designers)
- Offer to share learnings

### Language That Worked

| For Designers | For Startups |
|---------------|--------------|
| "Client acquisition" | "Finding design talent" |
| "Good startup clients" | "Quality designers" |
| "Your experience freelancing" | "Your experience hiring" |
| "What's working for you" | "Where do current options fall short" |

### Language That Didn't Work

Sam tested one message without "not a pitch" framing:

```
I'm building a marketplace for designers and startups. Would love to hear your thoughts.
```

**Result:** 0/2 responses

**Learning:** The "not a pitch" framing is critical. People's guard is up.

## Response Quality Analysis

### Enthusiastic Responses

**Priya (designer):**
> "Yes! This is so needed. I've been saying this forever. I'd love to help you figure it out."

**@foundermark (startup):**
> "I've literally been looking for something like this. Upwork is a nightmare. When can we talk?"

**Mei (startup):**
> "This would be amazing. I've wasted so much time and money on bad designer matches."

### Cautious Responses

**Alex (designer):**
> "Maybe. What are you planning to do with the info? I've talked to a few people 'researching' who turned out to be pitching."

**@techfounder_j (startup):**
> "Sure, 15 min max. I've got limited time."

### Non-Responses

**@creative_nina:** Read the message (blue check on Twitter DM) but didn't respond. Sam didn't follow up - respected the implicit no.

**@sarahbuilds:** Unknown if read. Sam sent one follow-up after 5 days, no response.

---

## Follow-up Strategy

Sam's approach to follow-ups:

**Rule:** One follow-up after 5 days, then stop.

**Follow-up template:**
```
Hey [Name], bumping this in case it got buried. Totally understand if you're swamped - no pressure either way. Just didn't want you to miss it if you were interested.
```

**Results:**
- @sarahbuilds: Still no response
- Rachel (Discord): Responded after follow-up, converted to call

**Learning:** Follow-ups occasionally convert, but forcing it rarely works.

---

## Scheduling Logistics

### Tools Used

- **Calendly:** For personal network (scheduled easily)
- **"What times work for you?":** For Twitter/community (more personal)

### Scheduling Challenges

Some designers offered very limited availability:
- @productdesign_li: "Only free Thursday 9am"
- Alex: "I can do 30 min next week but after that I'm slammed"

**Lesson:** Move fast when someone says yes. Availability closes quickly.

---

## Time Spent on Outreach

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Writing/refining templates | 1 hour |
| Sending supply messages | 1 hour |
| Responding to supply replies | 1 hour |
| Sending demand messages | 1 hour |
| Responding to demand replies | 1 hour |
| Scheduling calls | 1 hour |
| Follow-ups | 30 min |
| **Total** | **6.5 hours** |

---

## Key Outreach Insights

### For Marketplace Validation

1. **Different messages for different sides** - What motivates designers is different from startups
2. **Personal network first** - 100% response rate vs. 50-75% for cold
3. **Twitter audience is gold** - Sam's existing following made this much easier
4. **"Not a pitch" is essential** - Both sides are skeptical of research requests

### For Sam's Specific Case

1. Designers responded faster and more enthusiastically than startups
2. Startups who've been burned (bad hires) are most engaged
3. Early-stage startups are interested but may not have budget yet
4. The problem clearly exists on BOTH sides
