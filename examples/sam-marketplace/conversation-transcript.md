### Transcript

**Sam:** Thanks for taking the time. Your DM response was really passionate - you mentioned Upwork being a nightmare. Can you tell me more about that?

**Jake:** Oh god, where do I start. So I tried Upwork when I first went freelance. I had a solid portfolio, years of experience, thought I'd find good projects.

**Sam:** And what happened?

**Jake:** First, the race to the bottom on pricing. I'd apply to a project, quote my rate - $100/hour - and see that someone from overseas quoted $15/hour. I get it, different cost of living, but how do I compete with that?

**Sam:** So you competed on price?

**Jake:** For a bit. Dropped to $50/hour just to get some jobs. And you know what? The clients who hire at $50/hour are NOT the clients you want. They haggle on everything. They want unlimited revisions. They don't respect your time.

**Sam:** *[Note: "clients who hire at $50/hour" - price attracts a certain buyer type]* So what did you do?

**Jake:** I quit Upwork after about 6 months. Went back to referrals. Which works, but it's inconsistent. I'll have two months of full work, then a month of nothing.

**Sam:** Tell me about the inconsistency. What does a dry month look like?

**Jake:** Stressful. You start questioning everything. "Am I good enough?" "Should I take that $30/hour project just to have something?" And then you end up doing work you don't want to do for clients you don't like.

**Sam:** *[Note: "dry months" - emotional toll of inconsistent work]* If you could wave a magic wand, what would be different?

**Jake:** I'd have a steady stream of quality clients. Startups that understand design, have real budgets, and treat me like a partner instead of a vendor.

**Sam:** What makes a client "quality" to you?

**Jake:** Good question. Three things: (1) They have a real budget - not trying to get something for nothing. (2) They know what they want, at least roughly - I don't want to spend hours extracting requirements. (3) They trust me to do my job - they hired a designer, let me design.

**Sam:** *[Note: Quality = budget + clarity + trust]* Have you ever found those clients?

**Jake:** Yeah, my best clients have come through referrals from other designers or founders I've worked with. When someone vouches for you, the dynamic is different.

**Sam:** Different how?

**Jake:** They already trust you. They're not treating it like a transaction. It's more like a partnership.

**Sam:** Okay, so here's what I'm exploring. A curated marketplace - only vetted designers, only startup clients, matching based on skills and fit. Would something like that interest you?

**Jake:** *[Pauses]* Maybe. Depends on the details.

**Sam:** What details matter most?

**Jake:** First - what's the take rate? If you're taking 30% like Upwork, I'm out.

**Sam:** I'm thinking 15-20%.

**Jake:** That's... better. Still money out of my pocket, but if the clients are quality, maybe worth it.

**Sam:** What would make it worth it?

**Jake:** If you actually filtered the clients. Not just anyone who can post a job. I want to know the client has been vetted too - they have budget, they're reasonable, they won't be nightmares.

**Sam:** *[Note: Two-sided curation - vet clients too, not just designers]* What if I told you the marketplace would vet clients? Like, only startups with real budgets, good track records?

**Jake:** That would be interesting. I've never seen that.

**Sam:** What about staying on the platform? Let's say you do a project through the marketplace, it goes great. What stops you from going direct with that client next time?

**Jake:** *[Laughs]* Honestly? Nothing. That's the problem with marketplaces, right? I'd probably go direct if I could.

**Sam:** What would make you stay on the platform instead?

**Jake:** Hm. If there were benefits I couldn't get on my own. Like, maybe the platform handles invoicing and payments? Deals with the annoying admin stuff? Or if there's a steady stream of new clients coming through, so staying on the platform means I don't have to hustle as much.

**Sam:** *[Note: Platform value beyond matching - admin, payment, lead flow]* Last question. If this existed today and met everything we just talked about - curated clients, vetted for quality, 15% take rate, platform handles admin - would you join?

**Jake:** Yeah, I'd at least try it. I'd be skeptical - I've been burned before - but I'd give it a shot.

**Sam:** What would make you skeptical?

**Jake:** I'd want to see that the clients are actually good. Maybe a pilot or something? Let me do one or two projects before committing.

**Sam:** That makes sense. Thanks Jake, this was really helpful.

### Post-Call Notes (Jake)

**Summary:** Jake is a good target - experienced, frustrated with current options, would try something new. The take rate is a concern but not a dealbreaker if value is clear.

**Key quotes:**
- "Clients who hire at $50/hour are NOT the clients you want"
- "A steady stream of quality clients"
- "Quality = budget + clarity + trust"
- "If you actually filtered the clients"
- "I'd probably go direct if I could" (honest about leakage risk)

**Problem validation:** 5/5

**Would join?** Yes, with caveats (wants pilot, wants to see client quality)

**Concerns surfaced:**
- Take rate (wants low)
- Client vetting (as important as designer vetting)
- Platform leakage (honest that he'd go direct)
- Trust (been burned before)

## Part 2: Demand Side - Startup Interview

### Participant: Chris (Fintech Startup, Series A)

**Background:**
- Co-founder & CEO
- Hired 3 freelance designers in past 2 years
- Past client of Sam's (good relationship)
- Team of 12, no full-time designer

**Call duration:** 32 minutes

### Transcript

**Sam:** Thanks for making time. So you've hired a few designers since we worked together - how's that been going?

**Chris:** Mixed, honestly. You were great, obviously. But finding other designers has been... frustrating.

**Sam:** Tell me about the frustrating parts.

**Chris:** So after you, I tried Upwork. Thought I'd find someone good for a smaller project - a landing page refresh. Got like 40 proposals in 24 hours.

**Sam:** And?

**Chris:** Most of them were garbage. Copy-paste proposals. Didn't read the brief. I spent 5 hours filtering through them. Eventually picked someone who seemed okay. Their portfolio looked decent.

**Sam:** What happened?

**Chris:** The work was... fine. Not great. Just fine. Like, technically correct but no spark. And I realized I was getting exactly what I paid for.

**Sam:** What did you pay?

**Chris:** $35/hour. Way less than you, but I thought for a landing page, it'd be okay.

**Sam:** *[Note: Price = quality correlation]* Did you try paying more?

**Chris:** Next time, yes. Paid $90/hour for someone who claimed startup experience. Better work, but then we had communication issues. They disappeared for a week mid-project. No explanation.

**Sam:** Ugh. What did you do?

**Chris:** Finished the project eventually, but never worked with them again. Now I'm back to asking my network for referrals, but it's slow.

**Sam:** What makes referrals better?

**Chris:** Trust. If you tell me someone's good, I believe you. I don't have to evaluate 40 portfolios. I just hire them.

**Sam:** *[Note: Trust and filtering are the core value]* What would make hiring designers easier?

**Chris:** Someone doing the filtering for me. Like, I don't have time to evaluate designers. I don't even really know what I'm looking for beyond "good design." If someone told me "here are three designers who are right for this project," I'd pay for that.

**Sam:** How much would you pay?

**Chris:** What do you mean?

**Sam:** Like, if a service did that filtering - found you vetted designers, handled the matching - would you pay a premium for it?

**Chris:** Over Upwork rates? Absolutely. Upwork is cheap but it costs me time. And time is my most expensive resource right now.

**Sam:** What's a premium look like?

**Chris:** I'd pay... I don't know, $100-150/hour for someone vetted. If I knew they'd be good, the premium is worth it.

**Sam:** *[Note: Willing to pay premium - $100-150/hr for vetted]* What would you need to see to trust a new platform?

**Chris:** Social proof, probably. If other founders I respect had used it. Or if you were involved - I trust your judgment.

**Sam:** What if I was building this? A curated marketplace, only vetted designers, only startup clients?

**Chris:** I'd use it. Especially if you were vetting the designers personally.

**Sam:** What about the startup side? Would you be okay being vetted too?

**Chris:** *[Laughs]* Like, to make sure I'm not a nightmare client? Yeah, that's fair. I'd actually appreciate that - means the designers would be committed.

**Sam:** What would make you NOT use it?

**Chris:** If the quality wasn't there. If I tried it once and got someone mediocre, I'd leave. First impression matters a lot.

**Sam:** *[Note: First experience is critical - high stakes]* What about pricing - would a 15-20% markup on the designer's rate feel reasonable?

**Chris:** I don't even think about it that way. I'm paying for outcomes. If the designer delivers, I don't care what the platform's cut is. That's their business model, not my concern.

**Sam:** Really? A lot of people fixate on the take rate.

**Chris:** Maybe designers care. As a buyer, I care about: Can I find good people? Can I trust them? Will they deliver? If yes, the money works itself out.

**Sam:** *[Note: Demand side doesn't care about take rate - supply side does]* If I launched this next month, would you have a project for it?

**Chris:** Actually, yes. We need a designer for our mobile app. It's been on my list for weeks but I've been dreading the hiring process.

**Sam:** That's good to hear. I'm not ready to launch, but I'll keep you in mind when I do.

### Post-Call Notes (Chris)

**Summary:** Chris is a validated demand-side customer. He's experienced pain, willing to pay premium, and has an immediate need. His trust is based on Sam personally, which is a double-edged sword.

**Key quotes:**
- "Time is my most expensive resource"
- "I'd pay $100-150/hour for someone vetted"
- "First impression matters a lot"
- "I care about outcomes, not take rate"
- "I've been dreading the hiring process"

**Problem validation:** 5/5

**Would pay?** Yes - has immediate need and budget

**Concerns surfaced:**
- First experience must be excellent (high stakes)
- Trust tied to Sam personally (not the platform)
- Startup vetting is welcomed (not a blocker)

## Comparing the Two Sides

| Dimension | Designer (Jake) | Startup (Chris) |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Problem intensity | High | High |
| Current solutions | Upwork (hated), referrals (slow) | Upwork (time sink), referrals (slow) |
| Key pain | Inconsistent, low-quality clients | Time-consuming, unreliable talent |
| What they want | Steady quality clients | Pre-vetted, reliable designers |
| Take rate concern | Yes - wants it low | No - doesn't think about it |
| Trust barrier | Skeptical, wants proof | Trusts Sam personally |
| Would try? | Yes, with pilot | Yes, has immediate need |

### Key Insight

**The two sides have different concerns about the same marketplace:**

- **Designers** worry about the take rate and client quality
- **Startups** worry about designer quality and don't care about take rate

This is good news: Sam can charge a premium to startups (they don't care) and use that to offer value to designers (curated clients, lower hustle).

### The Trust Problem

Both sides mentioned trust, but differently:

- **Jake** wants to trust the PLATFORM (see that clients are actually good)
- **Chris** trusts SAM (not the platform itself)

**Implication:** Early on, Sam IS the brand. Her reputation is the product. Over time, need to build platform trust independent of Sam.
