# Scenario: Sam - Two-Sided Marketplace Validation

> Pre-product founder validating a marketplace connecting designers with startups

---

## The Founder

**Name:** Sam Torres

**Background:**
- Freelance product designer for 6 years
- Previously worked at 2 startups (YC-backed)
- Large Twitter following: 34K followers (design/startup niche)
- Has connected designers with startups informally many times
- First-time founder

**Day job situation:**
- Still freelancing, but winding down clients
- Can dedicate ~20 hours/week to validation
- Has 6 months of savings
- Goal: Validate before going full-time

**Technical ability:**
- Strong design skills (can prototype anything)
- Basic HTML/CSS
- Has a dev friend who'd co-found if the idea validates
- Could build a landing page/waitlist without help

## The Idea

**Name:** DesignMatch (working title)

**One-liner:** A curated marketplace connecting vetted freelance designers with startups that need design help fast.

**The problem (supply side - designers):**
Talented freelance designers struggle to find quality clients. They waste time on leads that don't convert, deal with scope creep, and compete on price with offshore designers. They want steady work with good clients, but finding those clients is a full-time job.

**The problem (demand side - startups):**
Startups need design help but can't afford full-time hires. They try Upwork/Fiverr and get burned by low-quality work. They try referrals but their network is limited. They need someone who can jump in, understand the startup context, and execute fast.

**The solution:**
A curated marketplace where:
- Designers are vetted for quality AND startup experience
- Startups post projects with clear scope
- Matching happens based on skills, availability, and fit
- Platform handles contracts, payments, and scope management

**Revenue model (proposed):**
15-20% take rate on transactions

## Why This Might Work

- Sam has unique insight (lived both sides)
- Distribution advantage (Twitter audience)
- Clear pain on both sides (informally validated)
- Growing market (startups, remote work, design maturity)
- Network effects could create moat

## Why This Might Fail

- Two-sided marketplaces are notoriously hard
- Chicken-and-egg problem (need both sides)
- Take rate might be too high (designers go direct)
- Curation is labor-intensive
- Competition from Upwork, Toptal, etc.

## The Marketplace Challenge

Two-sided marketplaces require validating BOTH sides:

| Side | Question | Risk |
|------|----------|------|
| Supply (designers) | Will quality designers join and stay? | Platform leakage (go direct after first job) |
| Demand (startups) | Will startups pay for this vs. alternatives? | Price sensitivity, alternatives are cheap |

**Sam's hypothesis:**
> "If I can prove designers will join AND startups will pay a premium for curated talent, the marketplace can work."

**The sequence question:**
Which side to validate first? Options:
1. Supply first (prove designers want it)
2. Demand first (prove startups will pay)
3. Parallel (validate both simultaneously)

Sam chose: **Supply first, then demand**

**Reasoning:**
- Sam has better access to designers (personal network + Twitter)
- Designer experience is easier to assess (she's been one)
- If supply is weak, demand doesn't matter

## Validation Goals

### Supply Side (Designers)

**Primary question:**
Will quality freelance designers join a curated marketplace?

**Secondary questions:**
1. What makes a client "quality" to designers?
2. What's broken about their current client acquisition?
3. Would they accept a take rate? How much?
4. What would make them stay vs. go direct after first project?
5. What's their minimum project size/rate?

**Success criteria:**
- 10 conversations with quality designers
- 7+ express interest in joining
- Willingness to accept 15-20% take rate
- Clear articulation of what "curated" means to them

### Demand Side (Startups)

**Primary question:**
Will startups pay a premium for vetted design talent?

**Secondary questions:**
1. How do they currently find designers?
2. What's gone wrong in the past?
3. What would make them trust a new platform?
4. What's their budget range?
5. Would they pay a markup for quality/speed?

**Success criteria:**
- 7 conversations with startup founders/hiring managers
- 5+ confirm they'd try a curated marketplace
- Willingness to pay premium rates
- At least 1 express "I'd use this right now"

## Constraints

**Time:** 20 hours/week for 4 weeks

**Budget:** $0 (can't spend money until validated)

**Resources:**
- Twitter: 34K followers (design + startup mix)
- LinkedIn: 2,100 connections (mostly design community)
- Personal network: ~50 designers she knows well
- Startup network: ~20 founders she's worked with

**Non-negotiables:**
- Won't build anything until both sides validated
- Won't promise anything she can't deliver
- Will be transparent about stage (exploring, not launching)

## Sam's Mindset Going In

**Excited about:**
- Solving a problem she's lived
- Using her audience for something meaningful
- Potentially building a real business

**Worried about:**
- Chicken-and-egg problem
- What if designers won't accept take rate?
- What if startups won't pay premium?
- What if she can't actually curate at scale?

**Assumptions she knows she's making:**
- "Quality designers struggle with client acquisition" (from her experience)
- "Startups will pay more for vetted talent" (hypothesis)
- "Curation can be a differentiator" (hypothesis)
- "My audience will help me validate" (hypothesis)

## Timeline

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Week 1 | Supply validation - reach out to designers |
| Week 2 | Supply validation - complete conversations, assess patterns |
| Week 3 | Demand validation - reach out to startups |
| Week 4 | Demand validation - complete conversations, make decision |
