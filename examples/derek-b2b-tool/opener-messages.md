# Opener Messages: Derek's Outreach

> LinkedIn messages sent, the Value-First approach, and what converted

---

## Messaging Strategy

Derek tested two approaches:

1. **Research Request** - Similar to Maya's approach
2. **Value-First** - Offering something useful upfront (free audit)

His hypothesis: B2B buyers respond better to VALUE than to "can I pick your brain?"

## Message Templates

### Template A: Research Request (Control)

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your post about [specific frustration]. I've been there - spent 5 years as a PM at an e-commerce company watching founders struggle with exactly this.

I'm building something to help and would love to learn from your experience. Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call? Not a sales pitch - genuinely trying to understand the problem better.

[Derek]
```

### Template B: Value-First (Test)

```
Hey [Name],

Your post about [specific frustration] caught my attention. I spent 5 years in e-commerce analytics and I still see this problem everywhere.

I'm building ShopMetrics to solve this, but before I pitch you anything - want me to take a look at your store's data and send you a quick audit? No strings attached. I'll tell you what's working, what's leaking money, and what I'd focus on.

Takes me about an hour, and you get actionable insights either way.

Interested?

[Derek]
```

### Template C: Warm Intro Follow-up

```
Hey [Name],

[Mutual connection] mentioned we should connect - said you're doing interesting things at [Company].

I'm working on something in the e-commerce analytics space and he thought you might have perspective. Would love to buy you a virtual coffee and hear about your experience with data/analytics at [Company].

No pitch, just curious.

[Derek]
```

| # | Target | Template | Response? | Time to Response | Notes |

| 1 | Amanda K. | B (Value-First) | **Yes** | 4 hours | "That would be amazing actually" |

## What Worked: The Value-First Approach

### Why It Worked

**Derek's theory:** B2B buyers are busy. They get pitched constantly. "Can I pick your brain?" asks them to give. "Let me give you something valuable" leads with giving.

**Evidence from responses:**

Amanda: "That would be amazing actually - I've been meaning to do this but no time."

Crystal: "What's the catch?" (Skeptical, but engaged)

Grace: "Sure, sounds useful" (Low barrier to yes)

### The Audit Offer

Derek's free audit included:
1. Review their Shopify data (they gave view access)
2. Check their GA4 setup (screen share or access)
3. Write up 3-5 key findings in a Loom video (5-10 min)

**Time investment:** ~1 hour per audit

**Value delivered:** Real, actionable insights

**Conversion goal:** After the audit, offer a call to discuss findings and show how ShopMetrics automates what he just did manually.

### Example Audit Findings (Amanda)

```
1. Your conversion rate varies wildly by traffic source - Facebook traffic converts at 0.8%, email converts at 4.2%. You're probably over-investing in FB.

2. Your best-selling product has a 67% reorder rate, but you're not promoting it to new customers. Easy win.

3. Your cart abandonment emails are working - 12% recovery rate. But you're not sending browse abandonment. That's leaving money on the table.

4. Your CAC calculation is wrong because you're including non-converting traffic sources. Real CAC is probably 30% lower than you think.

5. You have 3 products that haven't sold in 90 days. Consider bundling or discounting to clear inventory.
```

## What Didn't Work

### Research Request in B2B

The research request template that worked well for Maya (B2C validation) underperformed for Derek.

**Why it failed:**
- B2B buyers are more skeptical
- "Can I pick your brain?" feels like a time suck
- They've been burned by fake "research" that was actually sales

**Quote from Hassan (who DID respond):**
> "Happy to chat, but I don't have much time and if this turns into a pitch I'm out."

**Lesson:** In B2B, lead with value. Earn the right to pitch.

### Cold to Non-Problem-Posters

Derek tried 2 prospects who hadn't explicitly mentioned analytics problems:

| Target | Result | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Isabel C. | No response | Scaling challenges, but not analytics-specific |
| Lisa R. | No response | Right profile, no explicit problem mention |

**Lesson:** Stick to people who have self-identified the problem.

## The Skeptical Response

Crystal's "What's the catch?" message required a thoughtful reply:

**Derek's response:**
```
Fair question. Here's the deal:

I'm building an analytics tool for e-commerce stores. The audit helps me learn what founders actually struggle with, and it lets me show the value before asking you to pay for anything.

If after the audit you think ShopMetrics would help, I'll show you a demo. If not, you keep the insights and I don't bug you again.

Worst case: you get a free hour of consulting from someone who's been doing this for 5 years.

Still interested?
```

**Result:** Crystal booked the call.

## Message Evolution

### First message (Amanda):

```
Your post about "drowning in dashboards" caught my attention. I spent 5 years in e-commerce analytics and I still see this problem everywhere.

I'm building ShopMetrics to solve this, but before I pitch you anything - want me to take a look at your store's data and send you a quick audit? No strings attached. I'll tell you what's working, what's leaking money, and what I'd focus on.

Takes me about an hour, and you get actionable insights either way.

Interested?
```

### Refined message (Kevin, later):

```
Hey Kevin,

Saw your comment about GA4 being "a nightmare to set up right." Been there.

I do free analytics audits for e-commerce stores - usually find 2-3 things that are costing real money (wrong attribution, missed opportunities, etc.).

Takes me an hour. You get a Loom walkthrough with specific recommendations.

Worth trying? No pitch unless you want one.
```

**Changes:**
- Shorter
- More specific value prop (Loom walkthrough)
- Explicit "no pitch unless you want one"

## Conversion Funnel

| Stage | Count | Rate |
|-------|-------|------|
| Messages sent | 12 | - |
| Responses | 7 | 58% |
| Agreed to audit | 6 | 86% of responses |
| Audit delivered | 5 | 83% of agreed (1 ghosted) |
| Demo call booked | 4 | 80% of audits |
| Paying customer | 1 | 25% of demos |

**Bottleneck identified:** Demo to customer conversion. Need to understand objections better.

## Follow-up Strategy

For non-responders, Derek sent one follow-up after 5 days:

```
Hey [Name], bumping this in case LinkedIn buried it.

The offer stands - free analytics audit, no strings attached. I've done 4 this week and every store owner found at least one "oh crap" moment in their data.

If you're too busy or not interested, no worries at all. But if free insights sound useful, I'm happy to help.

[Derek]
```

**Results:**
- Brian T.: Still no response
- Jordan P.: Responded "Thanks, but we're covered" (polite no)
- Elena M.: Still no response
- Isabel C.: Still no response
- Lisa R.: Responded "Maybe next month" (warm no)

**Lesson:** Follow-ups can convert "missed" messages but rarely convert "not interested."

## Time Spent

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Writing messages | 2 hours |
| Sending and tracking | 1 hour |
| Responding to replies | 1.5 hours |
| Conducting audits | 5 hours (1 hr each) |
| Follow-ups | 30 min |
| **Total (Week 1-2)** | **10 hours** |

**Note:** The audits were time-intensive but created real value. Derek decided this was worth it for the first 10 customers, but would need to systematize later.
