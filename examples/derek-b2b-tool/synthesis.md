## Discovery Calls Analysis

### Call 1: Amanda K. (Skincare) - CLOSED

**Problem intensity:** Very high
**Budget:** Confirmed ($99 is "a no-brainer")
**Decision maker:** Yes (founder)
**Objections:** "Been burned before" - handled with guarantee
**Result:** Signed up on call

### Call 2: Hassan R. (Supplements) - NOT CLOSED

**Problem intensity:** Medium
**Budget:** Unclear
**Decision maker:** No - has a "data guy" on the team
**Objections:** "I need to check with my team"
**Result:** Follow-up scheduled, went dark

**Learning:** Decision-maker qualification matters. Hassan seemed like a fit but he's not the one who uses analytics tools.

### Call 3: Frank H. (Home goods) - NOT CLOSED

**Problem intensity:** High
**Budget:** Hesitant ("need to think about it")
**Decision maker:** Yes
**Objections:** "We're in the middle of migrating platforms"
**Result:** Asked to reconnect in 60 days

**Learning:** Timing matters. Frank is a good prospect but not RIGHT NOW.

### Call 4: Grace N. (Baby products) - NOT CLOSED

**Problem intensity:** Medium-low
**Budget:** Not explored (call ended early)
**Decision maker:** Yes
**Objections:** "I'm not sure I need something new - I'm getting by"
**Result:** No follow-up scheduled

**Learning:** "Getting by" = low urgency. Focus on people with acute pain.

## Pattern Analysis

### Who Said Yes

**Amanda profile:**
- Solo founder (decision maker)
- Explicitly frustrated (posted about it)
- Tried and failed with other tools
- Clear budget ($99 was less than previous spend)
- Acute pain (losing sleep over decisions)

### Who Said No

**Common patterns in "no":**
- Not the decision maker (Hassan)
- Bad timing (Frank)
- Low urgency - "getting by" (Grace)

### The Winning Message: Value-First

| Approach | Sent | Response Rate |
|----------|------|---------------|
| Research Request | 3 | 33% |
| Value-First (audit) | 8 | 63% |
| Warm Intro | 1 | 100% |

**Key insight:** In B2B, leading with value outperforms asking for time.

The audit offer:
- Demonstrates expertise
- Provides immediate value
- Creates reciprocity
- Pre-qualifies interest
- Builds trust before asking for money

## Objections Encountered

| Objection | Frequency | What It Really Means | How to Handle |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|
| "I need to think about it" | 2/4 | Not urgent enough | Ask what would make it urgent |
| "I've been burned before" | 2/4 | Trust issue | Offer guarantee, show results |
| "Need to check with team" | 1/4 | Not decision maker | Qualify earlier |
| "Bad timing" | 1/4 | Legitimate - follow up later | Set specific reconnect date |

### The "Burned Before" Pattern

Multiple prospects mentioned trying tools that didn't deliver:
- Amanda: Triple Whale was too complex
- Frank: Hired an agency that "just showed us more charts"
- Hassan: Used 3 different attribution tools, none helped

**Implication:** The market is educated but skeptical. They KNOW they need better analytics, but they don't trust that tools will deliver.

**Response:** Lead with value (audit), offer guarantees, keep it simple.

## Product Feedback

### Features Mentioned as Important

| Feature | Times Mentioned | Currently Have? |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Simple/clean dashboard | 4/4 | Yes |
| Weekly email summary | 3/4 | Yes |
| Attribution clarity | 3/4 | Partial |
| Recommendations (not just data) | 2/4 | Partial |
| Klaviyo integration | 2/4 | Yes |
| Facebook Ads integration | 2/4 | No - roadmap |

### Features Requested (Not Currently Built)

| Feature Request | Source | Priority |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Facebook Ads data | Amanda, Hassan | High |
| Compare to benchmarks | Grace | Medium |
| Team sharing/roles | Hassan | Low (for current ICP) |
| SMS/Attentive integration | Frank | Low |

**Key decision:** Facebook Ads integration moved up in roadmap. Two of four prospects mentioned it.

### Pricing Feedback

| Price Point | Reaction |
|-------------|----------|
| $99/month | Amanda: "That's half what Triple Whale was" (positive) |
| $99/month | Frank: "Need to think about it" (neutral/hesitant) |
| $99/month | Grace: Didn't discuss - disqualified earlier |
| $99/month | Hassan: No pushback on price |

**Assessment:** $99 seems right for the value. The hesitation is about trust/timing, not price.

## Revised Sales Process

Based on learnings, Derek refined his approach:

### Qualification Criteria (Before Messaging)

Must have:
- Posted about analytics/data frustration (explicit problem)
- Founder/owner (decision maker)
- Active on LinkedIn (will see message)

Nice to have:
- Has tried other tools (educated buyer)
- Solo or small team (no committee decisions)
- In growth mode (urgent to optimize)

### Outreach Sequence

1. **Connection request** (no pitch)
2. **Value-first message** (free audit offer)
3. **Deliver audit** (Loom video, 8-10 min)
4. **Follow up** (offer demo call)
5. **Discovery call** (qualify, demo, close)
6. **Follow up** (if not closed on call)

### Discovery Call Structure

1. **Audit recap** (5 min) - What stood out?
2. **Problem discovery** (10 min) - How do you currently handle this?
3. **Demo** (10 min) - Show, don't tell
4. **Objection handling** (5 min) - What's holding you back?
5. **Close** (5 min) - What's the next step?

### Closing Framework

- If "yes" → Set up on the call
- If "need to think" → Ask what would make it a yes
- If "bad timing" → Set specific follow-up date
- If "not decision maker" → Offer to present to the team

## Unit Economics Check

### Current State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Messages to get 1 customer | 12 |
| Hours per audit | 1 |
| Hours per demo | 0.75 |
| Total hours to close 1 customer | ~5-6 hours |
| Customer LTV (assuming 12 months) | $1,188 |
| Implied hourly value | ~$200/hr |

**Assessment:** The math works for now. But audits don't scale - need to systematize or automate.

### Scaling Considerations

**Current bottleneck:** Derek can do maybe 5 audits/week max.

**Options to scale:**
1. Templatize audit (faster to produce)
2. Automate data pull (reduce manual work)
3. Hire someone to do audits (expensive)
4. Convert to webinar (one-to-many)
5. Build self-service trial (remove audit requirement)

**Derek's plan:** Get to 10 customers with current approach, then build self-service trial based on what he learned from audits.

## Customer Acquisition Forecast

Based on current conversion rates:

| Goal | Messages Needed | Time at Current Pace |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 5 customers | ~60 messages | 5-6 weeks |
| 10 customers | ~120 messages | 10-12 weeks |
| 100 customers | ~1,200 messages | Need new approach |

**Reality check:** Derek can't get to 100 customers with manual outreach. He needs:
- Referrals from existing customers
- Content marketing
- Self-service funnel
- Or paid acquisition

But for the first 10, manual outreach works.

## Key Learnings

### What Derek Got Right

1. **Value-first outreach** - The audit offer dramatically outperformed "can I pick your brain"
2. **Prospect selection** - Targeting people who posted about the problem = higher quality conversations
3. **Simple product positioning** - "Answers, not data" resonated
4. **Guarantee offer** - Removed risk and closed the skeptical buyer
5. **Closing on the call** - Amanda signed up during the demo, not after

### What Derek Would Do Differently

1. **Qualify decision maker earlier** - Hassan wasted time
2. **Check timing before audit** - Frank was a bad-timing situation
3. **Build Facebook integration sooner** - Came up multiple times
4. **Track why non-responders didn't respond** - Missing data

### The Biggest Insight

> The people most likely to buy are the ones who've tried and failed with other solutions.

Amanda had tried Triple Whale and agency services. She knew the problem was real, she knew she needed help, and she was skeptical but still looking. That's the ideal customer.

Someone like Grace who's "getting by" isn't urgent. Someone who's never tried anything might not believe it's a real problem.

**The sweet spot:** Educated, burned, still looking.

---

## Status

**Goal:** Find first 10 paying customers

**Progress:** 1/10 (10%)

**Confidence:** High - the playbook works, just need to run it more

**Biggest risk:** Derek's time. Audits don't scale. Need to get to 10 and then change approach.

*This is Derek's ongoing journey. He closed 1 customer from 12 messages - not a home run, but proof the model works. Now it's about execution.*
