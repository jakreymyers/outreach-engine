# Scenario: Derek - B2B Tool Acquisition

> Post-product founder finding first 100 customers for an analytics dashboard

---

## The Founder

**Name:** Derek Morrison

**Background:**
- Former Product Manager at a mid-sized e-commerce company (5 years)
- Quit to build full-time 6 months ago
- Has savings runway for another 8 months
- Domain expert in e-commerce analytics
- First-time founder, but experienced in product

**Day job situation:**
- Full-time founder (no other job)
- Working 50-60 hours/week on this
- Pressure to show traction before runway ends

**Technical ability:**
- Not an engineer, but technical enough to spec products
- Has a part-time contractor dev (met at previous job)
- Can do SQL, basic Python, no frontend skills

---

## The Product

**Name:** ShopMetrics

**One-liner:** Analytics dashboard for small e-commerce stores that shows what's actually driving revenue.

**Problem statement:**
Small e-commerce store owners (doing $50K-$500K/year) are drowning in data. They have Shopify analytics, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads dashboard, email platform analytics... but no single view of what's working and what isn't. They make decisions on gut feel because connecting the dots takes too long.

**Solution:**
One dashboard that pulls from all their sources and answers three questions:
1. What's driving traffic?
2. What's driving conversions?
3. What's driving repeat purchases?

Simple, opinionated, focused on action - not more data.

**Current state:**
- MVP is live and functional
- Integrations with Shopify, GA4, Klaviyo
- 5 beta users (friends and former colleagues)
- No paying customers yet
- Basic landing page, no real marketing

**Pricing model:**
$49/month for stores under $100K/year revenue
$99/month for stores $100K-$500K
$199/month for stores $500K+

## Why This Might Work

- Derek knows this problem intimately (lived it as a PM)
- Clear target market with budget
- Existing solutions are either too complex (enterprise) or too basic (built-in analytics)
- Shopify has 2M+ merchants - big market
- Recurring revenue model

## Why This Might Fail

- Crowded analytics space
- Building integrations is a maintenance nightmare
- SMB churn is brutal
- Derek isn't technical - dependent on contractor
- No existing audience or distribution

---

## Validation Goals

At this stage, Derek isn't validating the problem - he knows the problem exists. He's validating:

**Primary question:**
Can I find and close strangers who will pay for this?

**Secondary questions:**
1. What message gets small e-commerce owners to respond?
2. What do they need to see to trust a new tool?
3. What's the sales cycle length?
4. What objections come up?
5. What feature gaps block sales?

**Success criteria (next 6 weeks):**
- 10 discovery calls with qualified prospects
- 3 paying customers (not friends/former colleagues)
- Clear understanding of what message works
- At least 1 referral from a customer

**Failure criteria:**
- <3 discovery calls despite 50+ outreach
- 0 paying customers from outreach
- Everyone asks for features that would take months to build

---

## Constraints

**Time:** Full-time availability

**Budget:** $500/month for tools/marketing

**Resources:**
- LinkedIn profile with 1,200 connections (mostly product/tech people)
- No e-commerce owner connections
- No Twitter/X presence
- Basic landing page

**Non-negotiables:**
- Won't discount more than 20% (learned from beta users - cheap customers churn)
- Won't build major features to close one deal
- Must be a "real" customer (stranger who pays, not a favor)

---

## Derek's Mindset Going In

**Excited about:**
- Product exists and works
- Has domain expertise
- Ready to hustle

**Worried about:**
- "I'm a product guy, not a sales guy"
- Cold outreach feels sleazy
- What if the product isn't good enough?
- What if nobody cares?

**Assumptions he knows he's making:**
- "The beta users' feedback applies to the broader market"
- "Small e-commerce owners will respond to LinkedIn outreach"
- "The price point is right"
- "The current features are enough to sell"
