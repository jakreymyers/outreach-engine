# Finder Output: Derek's Prospect Research

> LinkedIn-focused prospecting for small e-commerce store owners

---

## Target Customer Profile

Before searching, Derek defined his ideal customer:

**Ideal Customer:**
- Runs an e-commerce store (DTC brand preferred)
- Revenue: $50K-$500K/year (small but established)
- Uses Shopify (required for integration)
- Active on LinkedIn (or at least has a profile)
- Likely wears multiple hats (founder/operator, not just "CEO")
- Has expressed frustration with analytics/data at some point

**Disqualified:**
- Enterprise/large retailers (different needs, longer sales cycle)
- Pure dropshippers (low margin, high churn)
- Agencies (different product)
- Stores under $50K (can't afford $49/mo)

---

## LinkedIn Search Strategy

Derek used LinkedIn Sales Navigator (30-day free trial) to build his list.

### Search 1: Job Title + Industry

**Filters:**
- Title: Founder, Owner, CEO, Co-founder
- Industry: Retail, E-commerce, Consumer Goods
- Company size: 1-10 employees
- Geography: US, UK, Canada, Australia (English-speaking markets)

**Results:** 12,000+ profiles

**Problem:** Too broad. Need to narrow.

### Search 2: Title + E-commerce Keywords

**Filters:**
- Title: Contains "founder" OR "owner"
- Keywords: Shopify, DTC, e-commerce, online store
- Posted on LinkedIn: Last 30 days (active users)

**Results:** 2,400 profiles

**Better:** More relevant, but still need to qualify manually.

### Search 3: Engagement-Based

**Approach:** Find people who have TALKED about analytics frustrations

**Search queries:**
- "shopify analytics" + filter to posts
- "e-commerce data" + filter to posts
- "tracking conversions" + filter to posts
- "attribution" + filter to posts

**Results:** Found 47 relevant posts/comments from store owners

**Best quality:** These people have self-identified as having the problem.

## Communities Identified

Beyond LinkedIn direct search, Derek found these communities:

| Community | Platform | Access | Signal Quality |
|-----------|----------|--------|----------------|
| E-commerce Fuel | Forum | Paid membership ($200/yr) | Very high (serious operators) |
| r/ecommerce | Reddit | Free | Medium (lots of newbies) |
| Shopify Entrepreneurs | Facebook | Free | Medium |
| D2C Twitter | Twitter | Free | High (have to find the right accounts) |
| eCommerceFuel Podcast guests | LinkedIn | Free (search past guests) | Very high |

Derek decided to focus on LinkedIn for now (free, already has profile) but noted E-commerce Fuel for later if LinkedIn doesn't work.

## Targets Identified

Derek built a list of 20 targets. Here are the first 10 with his notes:

### Target List

| # | Name | Company | Context | Why Selected | Status |
|---|------|---------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Amanda K. | Skincare brand | Posted about "drowning in dashboards" | Perfect problem statement | Priority |
| 2 | Brian T. | Pet accessories | Complained about Shopify analytics limitations | Explicit pain | Priority |
| 3 | Crystal W. | Activewear | "Spent 3 hours trying to figure out ROAS" | Time waste = pain | Priority |
| 4 | David L. | Coffee subscription | Active poster, talks about growth challenges | Engaged, right stage | Secondary |
| 5 | Elena M. | Jewelry brand | Interviewed on e-commerce podcast | Established credibility | Secondary |
| 6 | Frank H. | Home goods | "If anyone has a simple analytics solution..." | Literally asking | Priority |
| 7 | Grace N. | Baby products | Posted about making data-driven decisions | Values analytics | Secondary |
| 8 | Hassan R. | Supplements | Talked about attribution challenges | Specific pain | Priority |
| 9 | Isabel C. | Fashion accessories | Growing fast, posted about scaling challenges | Right stage | Secondary |
| 10 | Jordan P. | Outdoor gear | "Google Analytics is a nightmare" | Explicit pain | Priority |

### Priority Ranking Logic

**Priority 1 (Message first):** People who have EXPLICITLY mentioned analytics frustration
- Amanda, Brian, Crystal, Frank, Hassan, Jordan

**Priority 2 (Message next):** People who seem like the right fit but haven't explicitly mentioned the problem
- David, Elena, Grace, Isabel

### What Derek Looked For

For each prospect, he checked:

1. **Are they actually a founder/owner?** (not marketing manager)
2. **Is the store real?** (checked their website)
3. **Right size?** (estimated from team size, product catalog, social following)
4. **Active on LinkedIn?** (posted in last 30 days)
5. **Any mutual connections?** (for warm intro potential)

## Sample Prospect Research: Amanda K.

Derek did deeper research on his top prospects. Here's Amanda:

**LinkedIn headline:** Founder @ [Brand] | Clean Skincare for Real Skin

**About section excerpt:**
> "...I started [Brand] after struggling to find skincare that actually worked for my sensitive skin. We've grown from my apartment to a team of 4..."

**Recent posts:**
- "The curse of having too many dashboards. Shopify says one thing, GA says another, Klaviyo says a third. I spent 2 hours yesterday just trying to figure out our real CAC."
- "Hot take: most analytics tools are built for data analysts, not founders who need to make quick decisions."

**Company research:**
- Website shows ~50 products
- Active Instagram with 23K followers
- Shopify store (confirmed by URL structure)
- Team of 4 (per LinkedIn, confirmed on About page)
- Likely revenue: $200K-$400K based on social presence and team size

**Mutual connections:** None, but she follows 3 e-commerce podcasters Derek also follows

**Personalization angle:** Her "too many dashboards" post is PERFECT. Lead with that exact pain.

## Outreach Priority Queue

Based on research, Derek prioritized:

**Tier 1: Send this week (explicit problem)**
1. Amanda K. - "drowning in dashboards" post
2. Frank H. - "if anyone has a solution" post
3. Brian T. - Shopify analytics limitations
4. Crystal W. - ROAS frustration
5. Hassan R. - attribution challenges
6. Jordan P. - GA nightmare

**Tier 2: Send next week (good fit, less explicit)**
7. David L. - growth challenges
8. Grace N. - data-driven decisions
9. Elena M. - podcast credibility
10. Isabel C. - scaling challenges

**Tier 3: Backup list**
- 10 more prospects from the broader search

---

## LinkedIn Connection Strategy

Derek realized he needed to connect before messaging (LinkedIn limits InMails).

**Connection request approach:**
Don't pitch in the connection request. Just:
> "Hey [Name], I've been following your posts about [topic]. Fellow e-commerce nerd here. Would love to connect."

**Success rate:** ~40% acceptance on connection requests

**Timing:** Wait 1-2 days after connection before sending pitch message

---

## Warm Intro Potential

Derek scanned for mutual connections:

| Target | Mutual Connection | Relationship |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| Amanda K. | None | N/A |
| David L. | Mike (former colleague) | Worth asking |
| Elena M. | Sarah (PM community) | Weak tie |

Derek decided to ask Mike for intro to David, pursue the rest cold.

---

## Time Spent

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Setting up Sales Navigator | 30 min |
| Running searches | 1 hour |
| Qualifying profiles | 2 hours |
| Deep research on Tier 1 | 2 hours |
| Building outreach queue | 30 min |
| **Total** | **6 hours** |

---

## Key Insight from Research

The best prospects aren't just "e-commerce founders."

They're founders who have **publicly expressed frustration with analytics**.

This seems obvious in retrospect, but it changed Derek's approach:
- Instead of blasting 100 generic e-commerce founders
- Focus on 10 people who have already said they have the problem

Quality > Quantity at this stage.
