- Derek's goal: Show how ShopMetrics automates what he did manually, close the sale

**Call format:** Zoom, 30 minutes scheduled
**Actual duration:** 42 minutes

## The Audit Recap (First 5 minutes)

**Derek:** Thanks for taking the time. So you watched the audit video - what stood out?

**Amanda:** Honestly, all of it. But the thing about my CAC being wrong? That's been driving me crazy. I kept thinking my numbers were off but I couldn't figure out why.

**Derek:** Yeah, it's a common problem. You were including all your Shopify traffic in the denominator, but a lot of that traffic is branded search - people who already know you. That inflates your traffic number and makes your CAC look higher than it actually is.

**Amanda:** Right, you said my real CAC is probably around $28, not $42. That's... actually encouraging.

**Derek:** It should be. You're doing better than you thought. The question is, how often do you recalculate this?

**Amanda:** *[Laughs]* I don't. I looked at it once three months ago and I've been using that number ever since.

**Derek:** And that's the problem I'm trying to solve. You're running a business on stale data because getting fresh data is a pain.

**Amanda:** Yeah.

## Discovery Questions (Minutes 5-15)

**Derek:** Can I ask you some questions about how you currently handle this? I want to make sure I'm not making assumptions.

**Amanda:** Sure.

**Derek:** Walk me through what happens when you want to know how a campaign is performing.

**Amanda:** Okay, so let's say I just sent an email campaign and I want to know how it did. I'd go to Klaviyo, look at opens and clicks. Then I'd go to Shopify, filter by that time period, try to match up the sales. Then maybe check GA to see if the traffic numbers line up. And half the time they don't line up, so I just... guess.

**Derek:** How long does that take?

**Amanda:** Honestly? If I really try to do it right, an hour. Usually I don't have an hour, so I just look at Klaviyo and assume the sales are correlated.

**Derek:** And how confident are you in those assumptions?

**Amanda:** *[Pauses]* Maybe 50%? I know I'm missing stuff. But I don't have time to become a data analyst. I have products to source and customers to deal with.

**Derek:** Totally get it. What about bigger decisions - like, "should I keep spending on Facebook?"

**Amanda:** That's the one I lose sleep over. I spend like $3K a month on Facebook. I THINK it's working, but when I look at the Shopify attribution, it shows almost nothing from Facebook. But when I pause Facebook, my sales drop. So something's going on, I just can't see it clearly.

**Derek:** *[Note: Attribution pain - exact problem ShopMetrics solves]* Have you tried any tools to help with this?

**Amanda:** I tried Triple Whale for a bit. It was like $200 a month and I felt like I needed a PhD to use it. Canceled after two months.

**Derek:** What didn't work about it?

**Amanda:** It just showed me MORE data. Like, yes, I can see seventeen different attribution models, but which one is RIGHT? I just want someone to tell me "this is working, this isn't, do more of A and less of B."

## The Demo (Minutes 15-25)

**Derek:** That's exactly what I'm building. Can I show you?

**Amanda:** Please.

*[Screen share - ShopMetrics dashboard]*

**Derek:** So this is pulling from your Shopify and GA4 - you gave me access for the audit. Here's your dashboard.

**Amanda:** Oh wow, that's... cleaner than I expected.

**Derek:** That's intentional. I'm not trying to show you all the data. I'm trying to answer questions. This box answers "What's driving traffic?" This one answers "What's converting?" This one answers "Who's coming back?"

See this? It's showing that your email traffic converts 4x better than your paid social. You probably knew that intuitively, but now it's quantified.

**Amanda:** Yeah, I knew email was good, but 4x is... I should probably send more email.

**Derek:** Maybe. Look at this though - your email list size hasn't grown in two months. Your paid social might be working as a list builder even if it's not converting directly.

**Amanda:** *[Leans in]* Okay, I didn't think of it that way.

**Derek:** This is what I mean by opinionated. I'm not just showing you the data. I'm trying to tell you the story.

**Amanda:** What about that Facebook attribution thing?

**Derek:** So, I can't magically solve attribution - no one can. But what I CAN do is show you the correlation patterns. Look, here's your traffic from Facebook over the last 60 days, and here's your conversion rate. See how they move together? You're right that Facebook is doing something. It's probably not getting credit in last-click attribution, but the traffic is contributing.

**Amanda:** That's actually really helpful. I've been trying to figure this out for months.

## Objection Handling (Minutes 25-35)

**Derek:** So, what questions do you have?

**Amanda:** How much is this?

**Derek:** $99 a month for your revenue range.

**Amanda:** *[Pause]* That's half what Triple Whale was.

**Derek:** Yeah, because it's half as complicated. I'm not trying to be Triple Whale. I'm trying to give you the 20% of insights that drive 80% of decisions.

**Amanda:** What if it doesn't work for me? Like, what if I sign up and it's just another dashboard I don't look at?

**Derek:** Fair concern. Here's my offer: try it for a month. If after 30 days you haven't made at least one decision you wouldn't have made otherwise, I'll refund you. No questions asked.

**Amanda:** Really?

**Derek:** Yeah. I'm confident in the product, and I'd rather have happy customers than trapped ones.

**Amanda:** Okay, what do I need to do to set it up?

**Derek:** You've already got Shopify and GA4 connected from the audit. I just need to flip the switch to make it live. Takes five minutes.

**Amanda:** What about Klaviyo?

**Derek:** That's a click-through connection. You'd log into Klaviyo, authorize ShopMetrics, and it'll start pulling in your email data.

**Amanda:** And then what? How do I actually USE it?

**Derek:** Every Monday morning, you'll get an email summary - here's what happened last week, here's what's trending, here's one thing to pay attention to. That takes two minutes to read. If you want to dig deeper, you open the dashboard. But honestly? Most of my users just read the Monday email and only open the dashboard when something looks off.

**Amanda:** I like that. I don't want another thing to check every day.

## The Close (Minutes 35-42)

**Derek:** So, what's holding you back?

**Amanda:** Honestly? Nothing. This seems like a no-brainer at $99. I'm just... I've been burned before, you know? I've paid for so many tools that promised to solve this.

**Derek:** I get it. That's why I did the audit first - I wanted you to see value before you paid anything.

**Amanda:** Yeah, that was smart. The audit alone was worth more than most of the paid tools I've tried.

**Derek:** So here's what I'd suggest: sign up for a month. Use it for 30 days. If it's not helping you make better decisions, cancel and I'll refund you. If it IS helping, stay on. And if you know other founders who are struggling with this, introduce me - that's my ask.

**Amanda:** That's fair. Okay, let's do it.

**Derek:** Amazing. I'll send you the signup link right now. You can use the card on file with Shopify or add a new one. First charge is today, then monthly from there.

*[Amanda signs up during the call]*

**Derek:** You're in. You should see data populating within an hour. First Monday email goes out day after tomorrow.

**Amanda:** Perfect. And hey - I do know a few people who'd probably want this. Let me see how it works for a couple weeks and then I'll make some intros.

**Derek:** That would be huge. Thank you.

## Post-Call Notes

**Summary:** Amanda is Derek's first paying customer from cold outreach. The free audit built trust, the demo showed clear value, the 30-day guarantee removed risk.

**Key quotes:**
- "This is more useful than the last agency I paid $2K"
- "I just want someone to tell me 'this is working, this isn't'"
- "4x is... I should probably send more email"
- "The audit alone was worth more than most paid tools I've tried"

**What worked:**
- Value-first approach (audit) built trust before asking for money
- Demo was focused on ANSWERS, not features
- Monday email summary = low friction ongoing engagement
- 30-day guarantee removed purchase risk
- Asked for referrals as part of the deal

**What to improve:**
- Amanda hesitated on price even though it was lower than competition. Need better framing on value.
- "Burned before" is a common objection. Need stories of successful customers.
- Setup process should be even simpler (one-click ideal).

**Next steps:**
- Send Amanda a welcome email with quick start guide
- Check in after 3 days to make sure data is flowing
- Check in after first Monday email to see if it landed
- Follow up in 2 weeks about referrals

**Revenue impact:** +$99 MRR

## The Objection That Almost Sunk It

The moment Derek almost lost the sale:

> "What if I sign up and it's just another dashboard I don't look at?"

This is a TRUST objection disguised as a feature objection. Amanda isn't asking about the dashboard. She's asking "will this be different from all the other stuff I've tried?"

**What Derek did right:**
1. Acknowledged the concern ("Fair concern")
2. Offered a guarantee (30-day refund)
3. Reframed the product (Monday email = low friction)

**What could have gone wrong:**
- Listing features (misses the emotional point)
- Getting defensive ("our dashboard is different because...")
- Discounting (devalues the product)

**Lesson:** When someone asks about features, listen for the emotion underneath.
