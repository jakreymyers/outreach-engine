## How to Use This Tracker

**The goal:** 10 real conversations in your first week.

Not 10 messages sent. Not 10 profile views. 10 actual conversations where you learn something.

This tracker keeps you honest about that number.

### Workflow

1. **Add prospects** as you find them (use the Finder to generate targets)
2. **Update status** after each touchpoint
3. **Log responses** verbatim when possible (exact words matter)
4. **Schedule follow-ups** for non-responses (once, then move on)
5. **Mark completed** when you've had the conversation OR decided they're not a fit

### Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `identified` | Found them, haven't reached out yet |
| `messaged` | First outreach sent |
| `follow-up` | Sent follow-up, waiting for response |
| `scheduled` | Conversation booked |
| `completed` | Had the conversation |
| `no-response` | Two touches, no reply (move on) |
| `declined` | They said no (that's data too) |

### Column Guide

**Name**: First name + last initial is fine. You're tracking people, not building a CRM.

**Channel**: Where you found them / where you're reaching out
- `linkedin` - LinkedIn DM or connection request
- `twitter` - X/Twitter DM
- `reddit` - Reddit DM or comment
- `email` - Cold email
- `intro` - Warm introduction from someone else
- `community` - Slack, Discord, forum

**Company/Context**: Why they're relevant. This is for YOU to remember why you added them.
- "Runs fitness app, complained about user churn on r/fitness"
- "E-commerce founder, 3 stores, talked about analytics gaps on X"
- "Freelance designer, active in Dribbble community"

**Status**: Use the status codes above.

**Message Sent**: Date + which template/approach you used
- "1/8 - Research Request v1"
- "1/8 - Value-First (offered free audit)"
- "1/8 - Peer Connection"

**Response**: Their exact words if possible. Even "not interested" is data.

**Conv. Date**: When you had or will have the conversation.

**Key Insight**: One sentence. The most important thing you learned. Fill this in AFTER the conversation.
- "Wants flexibility but won't pay for apps"
- "Already uses 3 tools, tired of switching"
- "Problem is real but not urgent enough"

**Follow-up**: Next action + date
- "Follow up 1/12 if no response"
- "Send recording summary by 1/10"
- "Connect them with [other prospect]"

## Tips for Effective Tracking

### Do

- Update in real-time (don't batch)
- Capture exact quotes in the Response column
- Be honest about "no-response" (2 touches = move on)
- Review weekly to spot patterns

### Don't

- Track vanity metrics (profile views don't count)
- Add people you won't actually message
- Let "identified" sit for more than 48 hours
- Forget to fill in Key Insight after conversations

### The 10 Conversation Rule

Research shows patterns emerge after ~5 conversations and stabilize around 10.

Don't pivot after 2 conversations.
Don't keep going to 50 if the pattern is clear at 10.

This tracker is designed around that number. Fill it up, see what you learn.
