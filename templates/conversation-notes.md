|-------|-------|
| Name | |

| How we connected | |
| Date & Time | |
| Duration (planned) | |

### What I Know About Them

From LinkedIn, their posts, their comments, etc. Don't go in cold.

- **Background:**
- **Relevant experience:**
- **Why I think they're a fit:**
- **Specific thing they said/did that made me reach out:**

### What I Want to Learn

Be specific. "Learn about their pain points" is too vague.

1. [ ]
2. [ ]
3. [ ]

### My Current Hypothesis

What do I believe right now that this conversation might confirm or challenge?

>

### Opening Line

Plan your first 30 seconds. Don't wing it.

> "Thanks for taking the time. I'm building [X] to help [Y] with [Z]. I saw your [post/comment/work] about [specific thing] and wanted to understand more about your experience with [problem area]. Mind if I ask a few questions?"

## During the Conversation

> **IMPORTANT:** Do not use AI during the conversation. Put your phone away. Close ChatGPT. The point of AI is preparation and synthesis, not real-time assistance. You have the conversation. You take notes. You're the human. Real signal comes from being present, not prompting.

### Key Questions to Ask

Start open, then go specific. Listen more than you talk.

**Opening (Get them talking):**
- [ ] "Can you walk me through how you currently handle [problem area]?"
- [ ] "What does a typical day/week look like when you're dealing with [problem]?"

**Pain Discovery (Find the real problem):**
- [ ] "What's the most frustrating part of that?"
- [ ] "When was the last time [problem] cost you time/money/opportunity?"
- [ ] "What have you tried before? What happened?"

**Solution Exploration (Don't pitch, probe):**
- [ ] "If you could wave a magic wand, what would be different?"
- [ ] "What would 'good enough' look like?"
- [ ] "What would make you switch from your current approach?"

**Willingness to Pay (Only if the conversation goes well):**
- [ ] "How much is this problem costing you right now?" (time, money, opportunity)
- [ ] "Would you pay to solve this? What's it worth to you?"
- [ ] "What would you need to see before you'd try something new?"

**Meta Questions (Always valuable):**
- [ ] "Who else should I talk to about this?"
- [ ] "What question should I have asked that I didn't?"

### Live Notes

## Tips for Better Conversations

### Do

- **Shut up more.** Aim for 30% you, 70% them.
- **Ask "why" five times.** Surface answers hide real problems.
- **Get specific.** "Tell me about the last time" > "How do you usually..."
- **Embrace silence.** Count to 5 before filling the gap.
- **Record if possible.** Ask permission first.

### Don't

- **Pitch your solution.** You're here to learn, not sell.
- **Lead the witness.** "Don't you think X is a problem?" = bad question.
- **Take notes on your solution.** Focus on THEIR problem.
- **End without asking for referrals.** Always ask who else to talk to.
- **Wait more than 30 minutes to do post-call reflection.** Your brain forgets fast.

### Questions That Reveal Truth

These cut through surface answers:

- "What happened the last time this was a problem?"
- "What did you try? What happened?"
- "If this was solved tomorrow, what would change for you?"
- "Who else in your situation deals with this?"
- "What would you need to see to believe [solution] would work?"

### Red Flags in Conversations

Watch for these - they usually mean the problem isn't real enough:

- "Yeah, that would be nice to have..."
- "I haven't really thought about it much..."
- "We just deal with it manually..."
- [Any answer that involves "someday" or "eventually"]
- [Lots of talking about features, not problems]

### Green Flags

These suggest you're onto something real:

- They interrupt you because they're excited
- They describe the problem before you finish explaining
- They ask when they can use it
- They offer to pay / ask about pricing
- They immediately think of others who have this problem
