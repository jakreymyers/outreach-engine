# Insight Log

> Aggregate learnings across conversations. This is where patterns turn into decisions.

## How to Use This Log

After each conversation:
1. Add a conversation summary entry
2. Update the pattern tracking section
3. Reassess your confidence levels
4. Check if you've hit a decision point

Don't overthink entries. Raw and fast beats polished and delayed.

## Pattern Tracking

Update this section after every 2-3 conversations. Patterns emerge through repetition.

### Problems Mentioned

| Problem | Times Mentioned | Representative Quote | Intensity |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Intensity scale:**
- `Hair on fire` - They need this solved yesterday
- `Actively seeking` - Looking for solutions now
- `Aware but passive` - Knows it's a problem, not urgent
- `Latent` - Doesn't realize it's a problem yet

### Current Solutions

What are they using now? What have they tried?

| Current Solution | Who Uses It | What They Like | What They Hate |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

### Willingness to Pay Summary

| Level | Count | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Would pay today | | |
| Would pay eventually | | |
| Interested but unlikely | | |
| Would never pay | | |

### Who Else They Mentioned

| Wrong customer segment | 7/10 say "my friend has this, not me" | |
| Market too small | Can't find more people to talk to | |
| | | |

### Persist Signals

| Signal | Threshold | Current Status |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Problem is real | 7/10 validate the pain | |
| Willingness to pay exists | 3/10 would pay something | |
| Can find more like them | Endless pool of prospects | |

## The Decision Framework

Use this after 10 conversations to make a clear call.

### Problem Validation Matrix

```
                    PROBLEM IS REAL
                    ---------------
                    Yes         No
                +-----------+-----------+
WILLING    Yes  | BUILD     | DANGEROUS |
TO         -----+-----------+-----------+
PAY        No   | HOBBY     | STOP      |
                +-----------+-----------+
```

**BUILD (Problem + Payment):** Green light. Start building MVP.

**DANGEROUS (Payment but no problem):** They'll pay for now, but it won't last. Find the real problem.

**HOBBY (Problem but no payment):** Real pain, no business. Find different customers or different business model.

**STOP (Neither):** Move on. Find a different problem.

### Confidence Thresholds

Don't make major decisions until you hit these:

| Decision | Minimum Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| "Problem is real" | 7/10 conversations confirm |
| "They'll pay" | 3/10 say they'd pay OR 1 actual pre-order |
| "Right customer" | Clear pattern in who has this pain |
| "I can reach them" | Can generate 20+ prospects easily |

### When to Pivot

Strong signals that you need to change direction:

- [ ] 10 conversations, <3 confirm the problem
- [ ] Everyone says "that would be nice" but no urgency
- [ ] Can't find more people to talk to
- [ ] Everyone keeps pointing to a DIFFERENT problem
- [ ] The people with the problem can't/won't pay

### When to Proceed

Strong signals you're onto something:

- [ ] 7+/10 confirm the problem is real and painful
- [ ] 3+ say they'd pay (or even better, ask how to)
- [ ] Clear pattern in who has this problem
- [ ] You can find 100+ more people like them
- [ ] Existing solutions are inadequate (and people know it)

## Export for Decision Making

When you're ready to make a call, summarize everything in this format:

### The Recommendation

**In one sentence, what should you do?**
>

### The Evidence

**Number of conversations:**

**Problem validation score:** /10

**Willingness to pay score:** /10

**Strongest signal FOR proceeding:**
>

**Strongest signal AGAINST proceeding:**
>

### The Decision

- [ ] BUILD - Proceed to MVP
- [ ] PIVOT - Change to [new direction]
- [ ] PERSIST - Do [N] more conversations because [reason]
- [ ] STOP - This isn't worth pursuing because [reason]
