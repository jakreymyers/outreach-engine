# Validation vs. Acquisition

> **Purpose:** Stage-specific guidance for pre-product validation vs. post-product customer acquisition.
>
> **When to load:** When determining approach for current stage, or when conversation style needs adjustment.

---

## The Two Modes

Outreach serves different purposes at different stages. Getting this wrong leads to wasted effort or missed opportunities.

| Mode | Stage | Goal | Mindset |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| **Validation** | Pre-product or pre-PMF | Learn if problem/solution is worth pursuing | Student |
| **Acquisition** | Post-PMF | Convert interested people to customers | Guide |

**Key insight:** The transition isn't binary. You may validate while having a product, or acquire while still learning.

---

## Validation Mode

### When You're in Validation Mode

- No product yet
- Product exists but unclear if problem/solution fit
- Pivoting to new market or feature
- Testing new positioning or pricing
- Learning about a new customer segment

### Validation Goals

| Goal | What You're Learning |
|------|---------------------|
| Problem exists | Do people actually have this problem? |
| Problem is painful | Is it painful enough to solve? |
| Problem is frequent | Does it happen often enough to matter? |
| Willing to pay | Would they pay to solve it? |
| Right solution | Does your approach resonate? |
| Right segment | Are you talking to the right people? |

### What to Ask in Validation

**Ask:**
- "Tell me about [problem context]"
- "What have you tried?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this?"
- "What would the ideal solution look like?"
- "What would you pay for that?"
- "What would stop you from using something like this?"

**Don't ask:**
- "Would you sign up for this?" (they'll say yes to be nice)
- "Don't you think this is a problem?" (leading)
- "How much would you pay for my product?" (too specific, too early)

### What NOT to Do in Validation

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Pitch your product | Biases their responses |
| Sell during the call | Changes the dynamic |
| Promise features | Creates expectations you can't meet |
| Ask for commitments | Too early, creates false signals |
| Demo anything | Anchors them to your solution |

### Validation Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| "That sounds interesting" | Polite, not painful |
| "I might use that" | Hypothetical, not committed |
| "Other people need this" | They don't |
| "Let me know when it's ready" | No urgency |
| Changes subject at price | Won't pay |
| No specific examples | Problem not real |

### Validation Green Flags

| Green Flag | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| "Where do I sign up?" | Real urgency |
| "I've been looking for this" | Active search |
| "I currently pay $X for..." | Budget exists |
| "This is a huge pain" + specifics | Real, painful problem |
| "Can I introduce you to..." | Sees value, wants to help |
| Asks detailed questions about solution | Engaged, evaluating |

### Validation Success Criteria

Before moving to acquisition, you should have:

- [ ] 10+ conversations with clear problem confirmation
- [ ] 70%+ described problem without prompting
- [ ] 50%+ showed willingness-to-pay signals
- [ ] Clear segment identified (who has this most)
- [ ] Common objections understood
- [ ] Competitors/alternatives mapped

---

## Acquisition Mode

### When You're in Acquisition Mode

- Product exists and works
- Clear product-market fit signals
- Goal is to grow customer base
- Understand who buys and why
- Focus on conversion, not learning

### Acquisition Goals

| Goal | What You're Doing |
|------|------------------|
| Convert interest | Turn curiosity into customers |
| Understand process | Learn how they buy |
| Reduce friction | Remove blockers to purchase |
| Expand market | Find adjacent segments |
| Improve messaging | Refine what resonates |

### What to Ask in Acquisition

**Discovery questions:**
- "What brought you here today?"
- "What are you currently using?"
- "What's not working about that?"
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "What would help you make a decision?"

**Closing questions:**
- "What questions do you have?"
- "What would the next step look like for you?"
- "Is there anything stopping you from moving forward?"
- "Would you like to try it?"

### What's Different from Validation

| Validation | Acquisition |
|------------|-------------|
| You're learning | You're guiding |
| Open-ended questions | Funnel-oriented questions |
| Never pitch | Pitch when appropriate |
| No demos | Demo when helpful |
| No commitments | Ask for commitments |
| All signal is valuable | Focus on conversion signal |

### Acquisition Red Flags

| Red Flag | What It Means | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| "Just researching" | No urgency | Qualify timeline |
| "Need to check with..." | Not decision maker | Get to decision maker |
| "Price is too high" | Value not communicated | Reframe value |
| "Not the right time" | No pain or low priority | Qualify pain |
| "Send me info" | Brush-off | Set specific follow-up |

### Acquisition Green Flags

| Green Flag | What It Means | Action |
|------------|---------------|--------|
| "When can I start?" | Ready to buy | Close |
| "Who else uses this?" | Looking for social proof | Provide references |
| "Can it do X?" | Evaluating fit | Confirm fit, address gap |
| Asks about pricing tiers | Comparing options | Guide to right tier |
| Invites colleagues | Building internal support | Expand conversation |

### Acquisition Success Criteria

You're succeeding in acquisition when:

- [ ] Conversion rate from conversation to trial/signup > 20%
- [ ] Time to close is predictable
- [ ] Common objections have proven rebuttals
- [ ] Clear ideal customer profile
- [ ] Repeatable sales conversation

---

## The Transition Zone

### When to Shift from Validation to Acquisition

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "Can I buy this now?" | They're ready, you're still validating |
| Consistent problem confirmation | Validation succeeding |
| Clear segment emerging | Know who to acquire |
| WTP signals strong | Pricing validated |
| Referrals coming | Product has value |

### Hybrid Mode

Sometimes you're doing both:

**Acquiring while validating:**
- Have a product, finding PMF
- Sell while you learn
- Every customer is also a research subject

**Validating while acquiring:**
- Have PMF in one segment, exploring another
- Sell to known segment, validate new one
- Different conversation types with different people

### Conversation Mode Selection

Before each conversation, decide:

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Do I have a product? | Consider acquisition | Validation only |
| Do I know this segment well? | Acquisition | Validation |
| Is goal conversion or learning? | Acquisition | Validation |
| Would I be happy if they bought? | Acquisition | Validation |
| Do I have clear pricing? | Acquisition | Validation |

---

## Stage-Specific Targeting

### Validation Targeting

**Look for:**
- People actively experiencing the problem (recent posts, questions)
- People who tried alternatives and failed
- People building their own solutions
- People in the segment you hypothesize

**Avoid:**
- People who might buy but won't help you learn
- Tire kickers
- People too polite to give honest feedback

### Acquisition Targeting

**Look for:**
- People with budget and authority
- People in active buying mode
- People similar to current customers
- People who asked for referrals

**Avoid:**
- People who match profile but show no intent
- "Researchers" who never buy
- Wrong-fit segments (even if interested)

## Questions by Stage

### Validation-Only Questions

Use these when you're purely learning:

1. "Can you tell me about the last time you experienced [problem]?"
2. "What have you tried to solve this?"
3. "What would have to be true for you to change your current approach?"
4. "What's the worst part about how you handle this now?"
5. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would be different?"

### Acquisition-Only Questions

Use these when you're selling:

1. "What's driving your interest in solving this now?"
2. "What's your timeline for making a change?"
3. "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
4. "What would help you feel confident moving forward?"
5. "Would you like to see how this works?"

### Hybrid Questions

Work in both modes:

1. "What are you currently using to handle this?"
2. "What's not working about that approach?"
3. "What would success look like for you?"
4. "What concerns do you have?"
5. "What would the next step look like?"

## Messaging by Stage

### Validation Messaging

**Tone:** Curious, humble, learning

**Example opener:**
```
Hey [Name],

I'm researching how [target users] handle [problem]. I came across your [post/profile] and thought you might have valuable perspective.

Would you have 15 minutes to share your experience? No pitch - just trying to understand the space better.
```

### Acquisition Messaging

**Tone:** Helpful, guiding, confident

**Example opener:**
```
Hey [Name],

I noticed you're dealing with [problem signal]. We built [product] specifically for [target users] facing this.

Would you like to see how [specific outcome] works? Happy to do a quick 15-min walkthrough.
```

### Key Differences

| Validation | Acquisition |
|------------|-------------|
| "I'm researching..." | "We built..." |
| "Share your experience" | "See how it works" |
| "No pitch" | "Demo/walkthrough" |
| "Trying to understand" | "Here to help" |

|---------|---------------|-----|
| Pitching | Biases responses | Save pitch for later |
| Asking about YOUR product | Leading | Ask about their world |
| Seeking commitment | Too early | Seek understanding |
| Demoing | Anchors them | Describe concepts only |

### Acquisition Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| Never pitching | Misses opportunities | Pitch when earned |
| Pure validation | Wastes ready buyers | Close when ready |
| Avoiding price | Delays disqualification | Discuss early |
| Not asking for sale | Loses momentum | Ask clearly |
