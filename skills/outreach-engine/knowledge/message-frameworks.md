## The Three Frameworks

Every effective outreach message uses one of three frameworks. Each serves a different situation and creates a different dynamic.

| Framework | Core Dynamic | When to Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **The Curious Builder** | "I'm building this, you seem relevant" | You have a product/idea, they're in target segment |
| **The Researcher** | "I'm learning, you have experience" | You're exploring, they have relevant experience |
| **The Value-First** | "I can help you, can we chat?" | You can add value before asking |

---

## Framework 1: The Curious Builder

### When to Use

- You're building something specific
- They show signal of being in target segment
- You want their perspective on the problem or solution
- Pre-product or early product stage

### The Formula

```
[Observation about them] + [What you're building] + [Why they're relevant] + [Specific ask]
```

### Core Template

```
Hey [Name],

I noticed [specific observation about their work/post/background].

I'm building [one-line description of what you're building] for [who it's for]. [Why they're relevant to this].

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to share your perspective? Specifically curious about [one focused question].

[Optional: genuine compliment or connection point]

[Your name]
```

### Examples

**For a solo founder who posted about validation:**
```
Hey Sarah,

I noticed your post about spending weekends validating your SaaS idea while working full-time. That discipline is impressive.

I'm building a structured validation workflow for solo founders. You seem like someone who's lived this exact pain.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to share your perspective? Specifically curious about where the process breaks down for you.

Either way, good luck with the launch - following along.

**For a developer who built a similar tool:**
```
Hey Marcus,

Saw you built that project management CLI for devs. Interesting approach to the "too many tools" problem.

I'm working on something in the adjacent space - developer productivity tools. You've clearly thought deeply about this.

Would you have 15 minutes to swap notes? Curious what surprised you most about how devs actually work vs. how you expected.

Jake
```

**For a marketing lead at target company type:**
```
Hey Lisa,

I noticed [Company] just raised your Series A - congrats. The growth stage is exciting and chaotic.

I'm building analytics tools specifically for post-Series A teams when everything breaks. You're probably starting to feel some of that pain.

Would you have 15 minutes to share how you're thinking about scaling your data stack? I'm trying to understand where the real bottlenecks are.

Jake
```

## Framework 2: The Researcher

### When to Use

- You're exploring a problem space
- They have relevant experience you want to learn from
- You're not yet building (or keeping that ambiguous)
- Pure validation stage

### The Formula

```
[Research context] + [Why them specifically] + [What you want to learn] + [Low-commitment ask]
```

### Core Template

```
Hey [Name],

I'm researching [problem space] and how [target users] handle [specific challenge].

I came across your [post/comment/profile] about [specific thing] and thought you might have valuable perspective.

Would you have 15 minutes to share your experience? I'm specifically trying to understand [one focused question].

No pitch, just research. [Optional: offer to share findings]

[Your name]
```

### Examples

**For someone who complained about a problem:**
```
Hey Alex,

I'm researching how founders decide whether to pivot or persevere - one of the hardest decisions in the journey.

I came across your thread about scrapping your first MVP after three months. That takes guts, and you clearly learned something.

Would you have 15 minutes to share that experience? Specifically curious what signals told you it was time to change direction.

No pitch, just research. Happy to share patterns from other conversations if useful.

Jake
```

**For an expert in the field:**
```
Hey Dr. Chen,

I'm researching how machine learning teams handle experiment tracking and reproducibility challenges.

Your paper on ML infrastructure at scale was incredibly relevant - especially the section on "hidden technical debt."

Would you have 15 minutes to share your current perspective? I'm specifically trying to understand what's changed since you wrote that piece.

No agenda beyond learning. Would be happy to share a summary of what I'm finding.

Jake
```

**For someone in target segment:**
```
Hey Priya,

I'm researching how first-time founders with day jobs approach customer validation - specifically the "finding time" problem.

Your comment in r/startups about doing user interviews during lunch breaks hit close to home.

Would you have 15 minutes to share how you've structured your approach? Trying to understand what works vs. what's just theory.

No sales pitch - genuinely curious. Happy to share what I learn from these conversations.

Jake
```

## Framework 3: The Value-First

### When to Use

- You can genuinely help them with something
- They asked a question or showed a struggle
- You want to build goodwill before asking
- You have relevant expertise to share

### The Formula

```
[Observation of their need] + [Value you're offering] + [Soft ask for conversation]
```

### Core Template

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your [post/question] about [their specific challenge].

[Helpful insight, answer, or resource - 2-3 sentences max that actually help]

If you're still working on this, I've been [your relevant context] and would be happy to swap notes.

[Your name]
```

### Examples

**Answering a question they asked:**
```
Hey Jordan,

Saw your question about finding early users without a network in the industry.

One approach that's worked: Find 3-5 podcasts in the space, look at recent guests (usually active and reachable), and reach out referencing their episode. Response rates are 3-4x cold LinkedIn.

If you're still working on this, I've been researching founder outreach patterns and would be happy to compare notes on what's working.

Jake
```

**Responding to a struggle they shared:**
```
Hey Michelle,

Noticed your thread about pricing anxiety - "How do I know what to charge?"

Quick framework that helped me: Find 3 alternatives, note their pricing, then position relative to them (premium, parity, or undercut) based on your differentiation. It's not perfect but beats guessing.

If you're still wrestling with this, happy to jam on your specific situation.

Jake
```

**Offering relevant resource:**
```
Hey David,

Saw you're building a Chrome extension. Noticed you asked about user research approaches.

Just finished "The Mom Test" and it completely changed how I think about customer conversations. Specifically, the part about avoiding compliments and seeking disconfirmation.

If you want a quick rundown of the key frameworks, happy to share - saved me some painful early conversations.

Jake
```

## Platform-Specific Variations

### LinkedIn

**Character limits:**
- Connection request: 300 characters
- InMail: 1900 characters (but keep under 200)

**Connection Request - Curious Builder:**
```
Hi [Name] - saw your post about [topic]. Building [thing] for [who] and would love your perspective. Open to connecting?
```

**Connection Request - Researcher:**
```

```

**Connection Request - Value-First:**
```
Hi [Name] - saw your question about [topic]. Have some thoughts that might help. Happy to share if useful.
```

**InMail (all frameworks):**

Keep to 4-5 sentences max. LinkedIn culture is more formal but brevity wins.

```
Hey [Name],

[One-line hook - what caught your attention]

[One line about you/what you're doing]

[The specific ask - 15 min call]

[Sign-off]
```

### Twitter/X DM

**Character guidance:** Keep under 280 characters for first message if possible. Twitter is casual.

**Curious Builder:**
```

```

**Researcher:**
```

```

**Value-First:**
```

```

### Email

**Subject line matters.** Options:
- "Your [post/talk] + quick question"
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Quick question about [specific thing]"
- "Researching [topic] - your perspective?"

**Email - Curious Builder:**
```
Subject: Your [specific content] + quick question

Hey [Name],

[Personalized opener - reference specific thing]

I'm building [one-line description] for [who]. [Why they're relevant].

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call this week? Specifically curious about [one question].

[Sign-off]
[Name]
[Optional: one line context about you]
```

**Email - Researcher:**
```
Subject: Researching [topic] - would value your perspective

Hey [Name],

I'm researching [problem space] and came across your [specific thing].

[One sentence on why their perspective matters]

Would you have 15 minutes to share your experience? No pitch - just trying to understand how [target users] handle [challenge].

Happy to share what I learn if useful.

[Name]
```

**Email - Value-First:**
```
Subject: Saw your [question/challenge] - thought this might help

Hey [Name],

Noticed your [post/question] about [topic].

[2-3 sentences of actual help - answer, resource, insight]

If you're still working on this, I'm [relevant context] and happy to swap notes.

[Name]
```

### Community (Slack/Discord)

**Tone:** Casual, match the community vibe.

**Curious Builder:**
```
Hey [Name]! Noticed we're both in [community]. Saw your intro about [thing].

Building [what] for [who] - sounds like you might have thoughts. Mind if I pick your brain for 15 min sometime?
```

**Researcher:**
```

Would you be up for a quick chat about your experience? Always looking to learn from people actually dealing with this.
```

**Value-First:**
```
Hey [Name] - saw your question about [topic].

[Quick helpful answer]

If you want to dig deeper, happy to chat - I've been thinking about this a lot lately.
```

### Reddit DM

**Note:** Reddit users are often skeptical of DMs. Engage publicly first when possible.

```
Hey - saw your post in r/[subreddit] about [topic]. Didn't want to derail the thread but [reason for reaching out].

[One of the three frameworks, brief version]

No worries if not - figured I'd ask.
```

## Personalization Cheat Sheet

**Best hooks by source:**

|--------|-----------|---------|
| Their post | Reference specific point | "Your point about X resonated" |
| Their company | Recent news/stage | "Congrats on the raise" |
| Shared experience | Common background | "Fellow [X], I noticed..." |

|-------|---------------|---------|
| None | 1-2% | "Hey, I'm building X" |
| Segment | 3-5% | "As a founder..." |
| Company | 8-12% | "Saw you're at [Company]" |
| Individual | 15-25% | "Your post about [X]" |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Too long** | 300+ word message | Keep under 100 words |
| **Generic flattery** | "Love your work!" | Reference specific thing |
| **Vague ask** | "Would love to connect" | "15 minutes for one question" |
| **Hidden pitch** | "Can I get feedback on my product?" | Be honest about intent |
| **All about you** | Three paragraphs about your product | Flip ratio - mostly about them |
| **Formal when casual** | "Dear Sir/Madam" on Twitter | Match platform tone |
| **Multiple asks** | "Call, or email, or answer these 5 questions" | One clear CTA |
| **No personalization** | Same message to everyone | At least reference one specific thing |

---
