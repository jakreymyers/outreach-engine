## Reddit

### Finding Relevant Subreddits

**Search strategies:**

1. **Direct search:** `site:reddit.com [your topic]`
2. **Subreddit search:** reddit.com/subreddits/search?q=[topic]
3. **Adjacent communities:** Look at "related subreddits" in sidebar
4. **User history:** Find a relevant post, check where poster is active

**Quality indicators:**
- Subscriber count: 5K-200K is sweet spot (active but not diluted)
- Recent posts: Multiple posts per day
- Comment engagement: Posts get 10+ comments
- Relevance: Posts match your problem space

### Finding Targets on Reddit

**Signal searches:**
```
site:reddit.com/r/[subreddit] "frustrated with"
site:reddit.com/r/[subreddit] "anyone know how to"
site:reddit.com/r/[subreddit] "looking for"
site:reddit.com/r/[subreddit] "I built"
site:reddit.com/r/[subreddit] "help me"
```

**What to look for:**
- Posts asking questions about your problem
- Comments describing workarounds
- Complaints about existing solutions
- "I wish there was..." posts
- Show HN / side project posts in your space

### Reaching Out on Reddit

**DO:**
- Engage in comments first (build history)
- Add value before asking
- Reference specific post/comment
- Use DM for private outreach
- Be transparent about who you are

**DON'T:**
- Create new account to spam
- Post self-promotion (many subs ban this)
- DM without prior engagement
- Be salesy in public threads

**Message approach:**
```
Hey [username],

Saw your post about [specific thing]. I'm researching this exact problem.

Would you be open to a quick chat? I'm trying to understand how people handle [problem] - no pitch, just learning.
```

**Subject lines that work:**
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Quick question about [their specific thing]"
- "Following up from [platform/event]"
- "[Specific observation] + question"

**Template:**
```
Subject: Your [post/talk/product] + quick question

Hey [Name],

[One line referencing something specific about them]

I'm researching [problem] and you seem like someone with relevant experience.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick call this week? Specifically curious about [one focused question].

[Your name]
[Optional: one line about you]
```

**DO:**
- Keep under 100 words
- One clear ask
- Specific to them
