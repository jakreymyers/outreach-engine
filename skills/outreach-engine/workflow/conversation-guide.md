## Step 1: Determine Conversation Type

Not all conversations have the same goal. Identify yours.

### Conversation Types

| Type | Stage | Goal | Key Questions |
|------|-------|------|---------------|
| **Problem Validation** | Pre-solution | Is this a real, painful problem? | Does it exist? How painful? Who has it? |
| **Solution Validation** | Pre-product | Would this approach solve it? | Would they use it? Pay for it? |
| **Customer Discovery** | Post-product | How do they buy/use? | Process, blockers, alternatives |
| **Feedback Collection** | Post-product | What's working/broken? | Usage, satisfaction, improvements |

### Type Selection Questions

Ask yourself:

1. Do I have a product yet? (No → Problem or Solution Validation)
2. Am I testing if the problem exists? (Yes → Problem Validation)
3. Am I testing if my solution works? (Yes → Solution Validation)
4. Am I learning how to acquire customers? (Yes → Customer Discovery)
5. Am I improving an existing product? (Yes → Feedback Collection)

---

## Step 2: Build Interview Script

Select questions from the question bank based on conversation type.

### The 12 Core Conversation Starters

These questions open up genuine dialogue. Use 3-5 per conversation.

---

#### Problem Discovery (Questions 1-4)

**1. "Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem]."**
- Gets them talking about real, recent experience
- Listen for: Emotion, frequency, specifics
- Follow-up: "Walk me through what happened step by step"

**2. "What have you tried to solve this?"**
- Reveals current behavior and workarounds
- Listen for: Effort invested, what failed, what partially worked
- Follow-up: "What was missing from that approach?"

**3. "What happens if you don't solve this?"**
- Tests problem severity
- Listen for: Consequences, urgency, who else is affected
- Follow-up: "How often does that happen?"

**4. "Who else deals with this problem?"**
- Reveals market size and segments
- Listen for: Patterns, segments you hadn't considered
- Follow-up: "Do they handle it the same way you do?"

---

#### Solution Exploration (Questions 5-8)

**5. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?"**
- Surfaces unarticulated needs
- Listen for: Features, experience, outcomes they care about
- Follow-up: "What would that enable you to do?"

**6. "What would you pay to make this problem go away?"**
- Tests willingness to pay
- Listen for: Anchoring, hesitation, comparison to alternatives
- Follow-up: "How does that compare to what you spend on [alternative]?"

**7. "What would have to be true for you to switch from your current approach?"**
- Reveals switching costs and requirements
- Listen for: Deal-breakers, must-haves, integration needs
- Follow-up: "What's the biggest risk in switching?"

**8. "If I built [solution concept], would you use it?"**
- Tests intent (but beware - people say yes to be polite)
- Listen for: Enthusiasm level, "yes, but..." qualifications
- Follow-up: "What would stop you from using it?"

---

#### Buying Process (Questions 9-12)

**9. "Who else would need to be involved in a decision like this?"**
- Maps the buying process
- Listen for: Stakeholders, approval processes, influencers
- Follow-up: "What would convince them?"

**10. "How did you find your current solution?"**
- Reveals discovery channels
- Listen for: Search terms, recommendations, communities
- Follow-up: "What made you choose that one?"

**11. "What would make you recommend something like this to a colleague?"**
- Reveals word-of-mouth triggers
- Listen for: Outcomes, experience, specific features
- Follow-up: "Have you recommended your current solution?"

**12. "What's the biggest thing I haven't asked about?"**
- Opens space for unexpected insights
- Listen for: Topics they want to discuss, blind spots you have
- Follow-up: "Tell me more about that"

---

### Question Selection by Conversation Type

| Type | Primary Questions | Secondary |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Problem Validation** | 1, 2, 3, 4 | 5 |
| **Solution Validation** | 5, 6, 7, 8 | 1, 2 |
| **Customer Discovery** | 9, 10, 11 | 6, 7 |
| **Feedback Collection** | 2, 3, 12 | 5, 11 |

---

## Step 3: Identify Red Flags

Watch for signals that indicate false validation or poor fit.

### Red Flags During Conversation

| Red Flag | What It Sounds Like | What It Means |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Polite agreement** | "Yeah, that sounds cool" | They're being nice, not honest |
| **Future tense** | "I would probably use that" | Hypothetical, not committed |
| **Vague enthusiasm** | "That's interesting!" | No real engagement |
| **No specifics** | "It happens sometimes" | Not a real or frequent problem |
| **Passing the buck** | "Other people might need this" | They don't need it |
| **Price avoidance** | Changes subject when money comes up | Won't pay |
| **Feature requests** | "It would need to do X, Y, Z" | Current solution not painful enough |
| **"Let me think about it"** | - | Usually means no |

### Red Flag Response Tactics

| Red Flag | What to Do |
|----------|------------|
| Polite agreement | Push for specifics: "Can you give me an example?" |
| Future tense | Ground in present: "When did you last deal with this?" |
| Vague enthusiasm | Test commitment: "Would you pay $X for this?" |
| No specifics | Dig deeper: "Walk me through the last time" |
| Passing the buck | Redirect: "But what about you specifically?" |
| Price avoidance | Be direct: "Budget aside, is this a priority?" |
| Feature requests | Question: "What's driving that need?" |

### Green Flags (Good Signs)

| Green Flag | What It Sounds Like | What It Means |
|------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Emotional language** | "I hate when..." "It's so frustrating" | Real pain |
| **Specific stories** | "Last Tuesday, I spent 2 hours on..." | Frequent, real problem |
| **Current workarounds** | "Right now I use a spreadsheet..." | Problem important enough to DIY |
| **Forward lean** | "When can I try this?" "Can you email me?" | Genuine interest |
| **Budget discussion** | "We currently pay $X for..." | Willing to spend |
| **Introduction offers** | "You should talk to my colleague Sarah" | Sees value, wants to help |

---

## Step 4: Prepare Follow-Up Questions

Have these ready to go deeper when you hit signal.

### The Five Whys (adapted)

When they say something interesting, ask "why" or "how" 3-5 times:

```
Them: "I check my analytics every morning."
You: "Why every morning?"
Them: "I need to catch problems early."
You: "What kind of problems?"
Them: "Traffic drops mostly."
You: "Why does that matter so much?"
Them: "Our CEO freaks out if we miss targets."
You: (Now you know the real driver)
```

### Follow-Up Question Bank

**To get specifics:**
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "Walk me through the last time that happened"
- "What did you do next?"
- "How long did that take?"
- "Who else was involved?"

**To test intensity:**
- "How often does this happen?"
- "What does it cost you when it does?"
- "What happens if you don't fix it?"
- "Where does this rank among your priorities?"
- "Have you tried to solve this before?"

**To understand alternatives:**
- "What are you using now?"
- "What do you like about that?"
- "What's missing?"
- "What would make you switch?"
- "How much do you pay for that?"

**To go deeper on emotions:**
- "How does that make you feel?"
- "What's the most frustrating part?"
- "What would it mean if this was solved?"
- "Why is that important to you?"

## Conversation Flow

### Opening (2 min)

```
"Thanks for taking the time. Before we dive in, can you give me a quick overview of [their role/project/situation]?"
```

Listen more than talk. Let them set context.

### Core Questions (10-15 min)

- Ask your 3-5 selected questions
- Follow threads that show energy
- Capture exact quotes
- Watch for red/green flags

### Depth Dive (5-10 min)

When you hit something interesting:
- Use follow-up questions
- Apply Five Whys technique
- Stay curious, not interrogating

### Closing (2-3 min)

```
"This has been really helpful. A couple quick closing questions:

1. What's the biggest thing I should have asked that I didn't?
2. Who else should I be talking to about this?
3. Would it be okay if I followed up as this evolves?"
```

### After the Call

1. Immediately fill out notes template
2. Highlight key quotes and insights
3. Note questions for next conversation
4. Update your hypothesis if needed

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Instead |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Talking too much | You learn nothing | Aim for 80% them, 20% you |
| Leading questions | Get false validation | Ask open questions |
| Pitching during validation | Biases responses | Save pitch for after questions |
| Not capturing quotes | Lose exact language | Write down their words |
| Accepting surface answers | Miss real insight | Always ask "why" or "can you give an example" |
| Rushing through questions | Conversation feels like interrogation | Follow their energy |
| Skipping the ugly | Miss disconfirming evidence | Actively ask what could go wrong |

---

## Iteration

After each conversation:

- **Didn't get useful signal?** Review questions - probably asking wrong things
- **Felt like interrogation?** Add more follow-the-energy moments
- **Forgot to capture quotes?** Practice or use recording (with permission)
- **All green flags?** Be suspicious - actively seek disconfirmation
- **All red flags?** Wrong target or wrong problem hypothesis
