## The Three Message Frameworks

Before diving into the workflow, understand the three core frameworks. Each serves a different purpose and situation.

### Framework 1: The Curious Builder

**When to use:** You're building something and want perspective from someone who deals with the problem.

**Core structure:**
```
[Observation about them] + [What you're building] + [Specific question]
```

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

I noticed you [specific observation about their work/post/comment].

I'm building [one-line description] for [target users]. You seem like someone who [relevance to them].

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to share your perspective? Specifically curious about [one specific question].

Either way, [genuine compliment or acknowledgment].

[Your name]
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Sarah,

I noticed your post about spending weekends validating your SaaS idea while working full-time. That resonated.

I'm building a structured validation workflow for solo founders. You seem like someone who's lived this pain.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to share your perspective? Specifically curious about where you got stuck in validation.

Either way, good luck with the launch - following along.

### Framework 2: The Researcher

**When to use:** You're exploring a problem space and want to learn from people experiencing it.

**Core structure:**
```
[Research context] + [Why them specifically] + [Low-commitment ask]
```

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

I'm researching [problem space] and how [target users] handle [specific challenge].

I came across your [post/comment/profile] about [specific thing] and thought you might have valuable perspective.

Would you have 15 minutes to share your experience? I'm specifically trying to understand [one focused question].

No pitch, just research. Happy to share what I learn if helpful.

[Your name]
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Marcus,

I'm researching how first-time founders decide whether to keep building or pivot - especially those balancing a day job.

I came across your comment about scrapping your first MVP after 3 months and thought you might have valuable perspective.

Would you have 15 minutes to share your experience? I'm specifically trying to understand what signals told you it was time to pivot.

No pitch, just research. Happy to share what I learn if helpful.

Jake
```

### Framework 3: The Value-First

**When to use:** You can offer something genuinely useful before asking for anything.

**Core structure:**
```
[Observation of their problem] + [Value you're offering] + [Soft ask]
```

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw your [post/question] about [their specific challenge].

[Helpful insight, resource, or answer - 2-3 sentences max]

If you're still working on this, I've been researching [related area] and would be happy to swap notes.

[Your name]
```

**Example:**
```
Hey Alex,

Saw your question about validating B2B ideas without a network in the industry.

One approach that's worked: Find 3 podcasts in the space, look at recent guests, and reach out referencing their episode. Response rates are 3-4x higher than cold LinkedIn.

If you're still working on this, I've been researching founder validation workflows and would be happy to swap notes.

## Step 1: Select Target and Gather Context

From your target list, select who you're reaching out to.

### Required Context

| Field | Purpose | Where to Find |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Name** | Personalization | Target list |
| **Signal** | Why they're relevant | Target list |
| **Platform** | Tone and format | Where you found them |
| **Recent Activity** | Personalization hooks | Their profile/feed |
| **Communication Style** | Match their tone | Their posts/comments |

### Context Checklist

Before writing, confirm you have:

- [ ] Their name (spelled correctly)
- [ ] The specific signal that made them a target
- [ ] 2-3 recent posts/comments you can reference
- [ ] Understanding of their communication style
- [ ] The platform you'll use to reach them

---

## Step 2: Choose the Right Framework

Select based on your situation and their context.

### Framework Selection Matrix

| Your Situation | Their Signal | Best Framework |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Building a product | They've discussed the problem | Curious Builder |
| Exploring problem space | They have relevant experience | Researcher |
| Can help them now | They asked a question/showed struggle | Value-First |
| Validating early | They fit profile but no specific signal | Researcher |
| Have some traction | They might be a customer | Curious Builder or Value-First |

### Platform Considerations

| Platform | Best Frameworks | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **LinkedIn** | Researcher, Curious Builder | More formal, professional context |
| **Twitter/X** | Value-First, Curious Builder | Casual, brief, public-friendly |
| **Email** | All three | More room for detail |
| **Community (Slack/Discord)** | Value-First, Curious Builder | Match community norms |
| **Reddit** | Value-First | Must add value or you'll be ignored/banned |

---

## Step 3: Personalize the Message

Generic messages get ignored. Personalization demonstrates you're a real person who did real research.

### Personalization Hierarchy

| Level | What It Is | Response Impact |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **1. Generic** | "Hey, I'm building X" | ~1% response |
| **2. Segment** | "As a founder..." | ~5% response |
| **3. Company** | "Saw you're at [Company]" | ~10% response |
| **4. Individual** | "Your post about [specific thing]" | ~20-30% response |
| **5. Contextual** | "Your post + my relevant experience" | ~30-40% response |

### Personalization Sources

| Source | What to Reference | Example |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Recent post | Specific point they made | "Your point about X really resonated" |
| Shared experience | Common background | "I'm also building while working at [type of company]" |
| Their question | Unanswered question | "Saw you asking about X - I've been thinking about this too" |
| Mutual connection | Shared network | "We both know [Name] from [context]" |
| Their project | Something they're building | "Saw your launch of [project] - how's it going?" |

### Personalization Don'ts

| Don't | Why | Do Instead |
|-------|-----|------------|
| "I loved your post!" (generic) | Empty flattery | Reference specific point |
| "I see you're a founder" | Too broad | Reference specific context |
| Reference old content (6+ months) | Shows stalking, not relevance | Stick to recent activity |
| Over-personalize (5+ references) | Creepy | 1-2 specific references |
| Fake shared interest | Dishonest, they'll know | Only reference genuine connections |

---

## Step 4: Generate Message Variations

Create 2-3 variations to test or choose from.

### Variation Types

1. **Framework variation** - Same target, different framework
2. **Hook variation** - Same framework, different personalization hook
3. **Tone variation** - Same content, different formality level

### Example: Three Variations for One Target

**Target:** Sarah, posted about spending weekends validating her SaaS idea

**Variation 1: Curious Builder**
```
Hey Sarah,

Saw your post about weekend validation sessions - that discipline is impressive.

I'm building a structured validation workflow and you seem like someone who's lived this. Would you have 15 min to share what's working and what's frustrating about your current process?

No pitch, just learning from people doing it well.

Jake
```

**Variation 2: Researcher**
```
Hey Sarah,

I'm researching how solo founders validate ideas while working full-time. Your post about the weekend grind caught my attention.

Would you have 15 minutes to share your process? Specifically curious about how you decide what to test vs. what to skip.

Happy to share patterns from other conversations if useful.

Jake
```

**Variation 3: Value-First**
```
Hey Sarah,

Saw your post about validation - one thing that's helped me: time-boxing each validation question to 48 hours. Forces prioritization.

If you're still iterating on your process, I'm doing research in this space and would be happy to swap notes.

Jake
```

## Step 5: Review Against Anti-Patterns

Before sending, check your message against common mistakes.

### Anti-Pattern Checklist

| Anti-Pattern | Check | Fix |
|--------------|-------|-----|
| **Too long** | Is it under 100 words? | Cut ruthlessly |
| **No personalization** | Did you reference something specific? | Add a hook |
| **Hidden pitch** | Are you asking or selling? | Remove any selling |
| **Vague ask** | Is the ask specific and easy? | "15 minutes" not "sometime" |
| **All about you** | Is it mostly about them? | Flip the ratio |
| **Formal when casual** | Does tone match platform? | Adjust to their style |
| **No clear next step** | Do they know what to do? | Make action obvious |
| **Generic sign-off** | "Let me know"? | Be specific: "Reply here or [calendar link]" |

### The "Would I Respond?" Test

Read your message as the recipient. Ask:

1. Would I read past the first line?
2. Do I feel like this person knows me?
3. Is the ask clear and easy?
4. Do I trust this isn't a pitch?
5. Would I feel respected, not targeted?

If any answer is no, revise.

### Final Quality Checklist

- [ ] Under 100 words
- [ ] Personalized to this specific person
- [ ] Clear what you're asking for
- [ ] Easy to say yes (low commitment)
- [ ] Matches their communication style
- [ ] No hidden pitch or agenda
- [ ] Genuine curiosity comes through

## Iteration

After sending messages:

- **Low response rate (<10%)?** Review personalization; may need to add hooks
- **Responses but no conversion to calls?** Check if ask is too high-commitment
- **Wrong people responding?** Review targeting in find-targets workflow
- **Unsubscribe/block?** Too salesy; review anti-patterns
